            For a while we sat and looked at the garden, feeling the cool, damp air flowing through the window and into the house. "Abby, you're first," said Suzy still staring at the open space. We secured and rolled out the rope ladder. "I want you to get across to the blueberry row as fast you can and keep a lookout," continued Suzy. Abby stuck her head out, trying to stretch out as much as she could. Then she leaned back in, then leaned out again, looked around, anxious. When she stretched out again and looked about, she leapt and was on the ground. She sprinted across, stopped at the first blueberry bush and turned toward us. Suzy was next. We secured a help line for her and clipped the carabiner to a ring on the front of her vest. Molly and I took a strong hold of the line as Suzy turned to face us, supporting herself on the very tips of her hind paws. We released a little bit of the line as she leaned back and eventually started walking down the wall, her back toward the ground. We kept releasing the line until her paws reached the ground. She then telescoped, unclipped the line, turned about and made a dash for the shrubberies.

        <div class="story-txt">Molly lept out as if it were normal, everyday routine for her. No hesitation, no looking about or pensive frowning.</div>

        <div class="story-txt">Not me. I liked being last out. I savored the moment as much as I could. I think everyone started to get  a little bit impatient when I saw Abby put her paws up in the air, waving "Get on with it already, will you?!?". I gave myself the old "ready-set-go" routine; for old time's sake. I rocked forward, then back, forward again and leapt out. After eternity of a split second I was out and on the ground. My head felt overwhelmed, luckily for me, my hind paws remember what to do and got the rest of my body hopping  over to the crew. </div>

        <div class="story-txt">As I got closer to the girls, I wanted to binky, but the vest was too much like a straightjacket and what came out instead looked like a terrible  hiccup, a hiccup so so bad it levitated me. "What the heck was that, Major?," laughed Abby. "Folks, it's really hard to binky in these things" I said, "I just wanted to show you and spare you the embarrassment." I telescoped proudly and smiled. We got close together, noses in the center, snuggling for a moment, trying to take in what happened.</div>

        <div class="story-txt">We all agreed that we need to take a survey of the veggie garden just on the other side of this blueberry heaven. Well, the blueberry season was mostly over and the only lonely berries left were little dried up and hidden deep in the bushes. We could not get to any of them and the  birds never did either, so that's those berries survived. But we'll be back. Oh, yes we will!</div>

        <div class="story-txt">Abby and I made up one team and Suzy with Molly the other. We would meet on the other side of the garden, under the old, tall fraser fir. Of course, a lot of stuff along the way had to be sampled and tested. No bunn knew when anything here was REALLY  tested. Thinking about sampling fresh greens made my jaws cramp so strongly I felt like my mouf was in a vise. </div>

        <div class="story-txt">I noticed the clouds trying to clear out. Some of them were running away through the sky, while others tried to chase them, determined to keep out any sun. But there were fewer of them than a minute ago. The light breeze felt great and the smells were like ... , well, they were like nothing I could recall. When I put my nose close to the ground, it smelled fresh. A real, fresh dirt, not some patchouli scented, hippie imitation of a memory buried long ago. The real stuff, right under my paws.  I just knew the world could do no wrong today!</div>
