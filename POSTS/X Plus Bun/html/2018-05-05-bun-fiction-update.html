            Pancake here, remember me? Our hoomin scribe reported that the fumes caught on fire at the tar pits on Tuesday and all went downhill from there. Then, the scribe complained that he got some stuff to sort out that could not be put off any longer.  Sigh ...  We got the story almost ready, but we had no chance to put together any doodles to go with it. Things got so bad that we resorted to digging deep into the archives to find a pic of my booplesnoot.

            Well, we'll regroup, and next weekend we'll know if Mr. Toes and the bunstronauts made it safely to orbit.
