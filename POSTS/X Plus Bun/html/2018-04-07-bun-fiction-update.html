		Greetings, Everybunny!
        </div>

        <div class="story-txt">
			We had one of those weeks where the harder we try to run the slower we went. It's hard to point to a single one event that grounded us. Was the computer upgrade saga? At least it's finally done. Was the tar pits? Was it the bunch of miscellaneous nicks and cuts to the soul? Sigh, at least we're past all that for now.

        <div class="story-txt">
		The good news is we have the next two episodes in longhand, and the final one is looming around the corner. We'll be back next week.
        </div>

        <div class="story-txt">
		In the meantime, enjoy some kale-carrots. If that's not your cup of veg, how about a dandelion-carrot?
