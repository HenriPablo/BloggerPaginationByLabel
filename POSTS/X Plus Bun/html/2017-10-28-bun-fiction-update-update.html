            When we realized that the scheduled bun fiction update grew to the size of a regular story post, it was no longer an update. So, we saved that one for this upcoming Tuesday. What happened? Well, the crew took a trip to visit the Story Assembly Building to see for themselves how everything survived the hurricane season. Of course, something had to go sideways. Do they come up with a spooctacilar save again? I guess we'll have to wait and see.

            What happened to the bad bunn rising you ask? Standing over and stirring the kettle at the tar pits does that.
