            We feel that Mr. Toes and his crew was in a similar situation. As a consequence of what happened to them during their last excursion into the Behemoth they face the dilemma of their lives. Now, new possibilities will open up before them. However, the weight of the decision they had to make on what to do next only grows heavier.

            We realized, as they have, that we're at a critical turning point in the Retrofire miniseries, and we needed more time to work out the next episode. The least we can do is to slow down and get it as right as we can.

            Of course, there's a lot of pressure coming from the cast members to just get on with it. Pancake and Molly are upset that they have not played in any episodes. They are threatening a labor action. Joey wants to know why he did not get a flight assignment in the series, but the "imaginary" characters of "Hopper" and "Mel" did.
