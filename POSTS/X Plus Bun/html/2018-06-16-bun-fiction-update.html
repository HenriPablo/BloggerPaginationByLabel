            The story became very nervous this week and ran away into the woods. We were very concerned about it because we had no proper ending for it. Then there was a tar spill at the pits and the fumes caught on fire. The resulting cloud of putrid stench made it impossible to track down the story and stitch up the ending to it. Finally, a couple of days ago, we found it hiding in an abandoned, dark burrow, scared to death and whimpering. It was surrounded by a pack of howling plot wolves, and we got to it just in time.

            The story is safe now and back in the Story Assembly Building. If all goes well, we'll be ready for launch next weekend. We still have some editing left and, of course, the doodles need work too.
