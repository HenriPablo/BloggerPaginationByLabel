            Hellos, Everybunny!
            <br/>
            I'm Ava, and I have a quick update. We are working on a three, maybe four, part story. If all goes well, we will post part one next week. There will be your favorite character, rockets, space, and adventures in creative farming.  Of course, there will be trouble. There always is.        </div>

        <div class="story-txt">
            We are debating what to do next. Perhaps we will turn our attention to completing the few early episodes of The Disapprovers saga. We had been away from that story long enough to take a fresh look at it. We still intend to shape it up into a book format.        </div>

        <div class="story-txt">
            As always, thank you for stopping by today, and we'll keep you posted.
            <br/>
            - Ava
