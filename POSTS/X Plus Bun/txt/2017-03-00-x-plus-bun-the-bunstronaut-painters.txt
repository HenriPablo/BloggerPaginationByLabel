X-Plus Bun - The Bunstronaut Painters

Bunstronauts on crew of the salvage vessel The Buzzard had a long day dismantling the the old solar smelter. No bun was sure what finally did it in. One report said a liquid coolant pump seized and a pipe froze shut, leading to the smelter burning right through the middle and breaking apart. Somebun else said the poor thing took a hit from a small meteor, right in the starboard side radiators. The smelter was great at taking meteors in its front and popping out ingots of iron and nickel out its rear end. but it couldn't take one in its side. The legend had it, the Buzzard itself contained metal processed by the old smelter. 

Mr. Toes and Abby were off the clock now. after supper, they headed to the old open observation room with pure, crystal clear stained diamond windows. Mr. Toes put  on a suit that Abby knitted for him, from blue cotton. It had a thick, comfy collar and faux suede patches on its elbows. she even knitted the logo of the space agency next to the zipper over the right side of the chest. He filled his pipe with catnip mahorka and before lighting it, disabled the smoke detectors in the room; strictly again regulations. 

The crew had the entire evening to themselves. They were about to rotate out for  a Recovery And Restoration period, so they could pull an artsy all nighter if the wanted to. They didn't have to get up for nobun the next day. 

A few years ago, it took Mr. Toes quite some time and effort to convince the director of operations to sanction  the live drawing classes as an official  cross-training activity for the crew. He started with the basics. First, he convinced the director that life drawing involved similar skills as remote robotics operations. Paw-eye coordination is crucial to both. So is single pointed concentration and the sharpening of perception skills. Thus, drawing exercises the same "mental muscles" as disassembly of an old space freighter with the help of robotic arms and drones. The  crew trains and doesn't know it. They experience only the joy and frivolity of sketching a classical beauty suspended in front of them in zero gravity. 

The director thought about it, furrowed his brows and twitched his big booplesnoot nervously. He demanded a proper report and documentation from Mr. Toes and only promised a fair consideration, offering no guarantees. Mr. Toes took it in stride and considered it a win. After all, dealing with such matters with a Flemish Giant like The Director is difficult on a good day. 

Later on, Mr. Toes found out that The Director only approved the idea after ridiculing it, and ranting, and raving about it to his wife. His wife, surprised, thought that it was a splendid idea. The Director knew better than to argue with a Rex. 

The crew slowly started to file in. Abby and Pancake showed up first. Then Penny, Ava and Joey. The drew lots to choose who would start the poses and it was Joey's lucky night. Every bunny helped to clear the room and secure everything to the walls, leaving the roof and a side wall unobstructed to let in as much light as possible.

They got heir drawings boards and secured them to themselves with thin straps. On orbit you can't really sit down and set your board on a bench. You are free-floating  and so is your board. When you press the charcoal against the paper, you are pushing yourself away from it. That's why it's best to be near something you can use to steady yourself against to keep as motionless as possible. A paw rail or a wall is good. Here, they run ropes from the "floor" to the "ceiling" so one could use the rope for support from time to time.

They had to work fast. It was not just the model changing it's position, but the light shifter at a tremendously fast pace, at least during the sunny part of the orbit. when the sun was blocked by the planet and the ship was in its shadows, they had about forty five minutes to work with a fixed, steady light source and somebun would try to stabilize the model. It didn't always work exactly to every bun's liking, but they always made the best of it. 

Mr. Toes called for a few fifteen second poses and Joey froze still. Then the swish of  charcoal sticks and graphite sticks filled the room. As Joey held still his pose, she was still turning relative to everybun, so the pose kept changing constantly. The effect was most pronounced when he was illuminated by the flash of orbital sunrise. He went from being lit by warming white to getting drenched by a flash green, then orange and gold, to yellow then by the most intense white only a nearby star can produce.


We did our best trying to capture Joey during the next set of poses lasting a minute each. We were warming up nicely. The challenge always came during the long poses. The process naturally produced pieced that in spirit  were aligned with the quantum nature of existence. Also, there was nothing revolutionary any more about those pieces. Not in this little circel anyway. The environment natually lead it capturing  all states of Joey. Micro gravity accelerated and forced every bun to deal with the fact of Joey having a back side as well as a profile. Joey's slow rotation forced the abstract nature of existence to the surface. A "Nude Bun Descending the Staircase" happened naturally and the representation of all of Joey's facets simultaneously was a given. 

This group's first contact with charcoal and paper happened here, on orbit. They have never known first paw the setting where the model would be immobilized by the bonds of gravity. Everybun here was used to dealing with life where all sides and facets of an subject had to considered.

Before I started this group, I wondered how they would take to this exercise.  On one paw they  were very different from their pit bun ancestors that mined disapprovium, iron and nickel. These gals and guys were professionals with engineering degrees and had never pursued anything like this on their own. Outside the confines of this "class", the only quality of line they cared about was how precise the line was and to be certain they only trusted the mathematical representation of said line. Now it turns out, they enjoy debating the quality of a line that wiggles and turns, thins out and thickens, tapers off to nothing and reappears tricking bun's mind into making up fragments of the line that don't exist. They are quite adept at critiquing each other efforts and for a change letting their guts and emotions drive their partners in art beyond their limitations. 

POSES
After a couple of simple poes, Joey assumed the arched position of a skydiver, after that he did a dance pose, then another one, but this time he turned himself upside down relative tothe artists. Positiong tht were previously impossible to observe in  a frozen state without the help of a high tech gadgets were on display for the taking. of course if you have a spaceshop studio available....

Pancake joined him toward the the end of the session and they held a few pair poses that normally would be considered high action and impossible to hold under normal circumstances.

THE LINE
the line turned and twisted, grew wider and thinner, disappearing in places and letting the eye and then brain fill in the missing fragments.

THE ART STAND
They mounted their papers on microscopically stabilized easels. They stepped into foot restraints and  and adjusted their orientation to the model with tiny thrusters using compressed air. From time to time they would vacuum off the small nebulae of charcoal dust building up and swirling  over the paper.
