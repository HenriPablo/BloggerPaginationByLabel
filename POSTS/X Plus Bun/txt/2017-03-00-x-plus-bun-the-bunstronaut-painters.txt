X-Plus Bun - The Bunstronaut Painters

Bunstronauts of the crew of the salvage vessel The Buzzard had a long day on orbit dismantling the old solar smelter. No bun was sure what finally did it in. One report said a liquid coolant pump seized and a pipe froze shut, leading to the smelter burning right through the middle and breaking apart. Somebun else said the poor thing took a direct hit from a small meteor, right in the radiators on the starboard side. The smelter was great at taking in meteors through its front ore manifold and popping out ingots of iron and nickel out its rear end, but it couldn't take one in its side. The legend had it, the Buzzard itself contained metal processed by the old smelter. 

Mr. Toes and Abby were off the clock now and the crew had the entire evening to themselves. They were about to rotate out for a Recovery and Restoration period, so they could pull an artsy all-nighter if they wanted to. The next day they didn't have to get up for nobun. After supper, they headed to the old open observation room with pure, brilliant stained diamond windows. Mr. Toes put on overalls that Abby knitted for him, from blue cotton. They had a thick, comfy collar and faux suede patches on its elbows. She even knitted the logo of the Space Agency next to the zipper on the right side of the chest. He disabled the smoke detectors in the room, strictly again regulations, and lit up his catnip pipe. Mr. Toes started to prepare the room for an open life drawing workshop.

A few years ago, it took Mr. Toes quite some time and effort to convince The Director of Crew Operations to sanction the life drawing classes as an official cross-training activity for the crew. He started with the basics. For starters, he convinced the director that drawing from direct observation involved similar skills to remote robotics operations. Paw-eye coordination is crucial to both. So is single-pointed concentration and the sharpening of bun's perception skills. Thus, drawing strengthens the same "mental muscles" as a disassembly of an old space freighter with the help of robotic arms and drones. The crew trains and doesn't know it. They experience only the joy and frivolity of sketching a classical beauty suspended in front of them thanks to microgravity. 

The Director, a stout and grough Flemish Giant, thought about it, furrowed his brows and twitched his big fuzzy booplesnoot nervously. He demanded a proper report and documentation from Mr. Toes and only half-promised a fair consideration, offering no guarantees. Mr. Toes took it in stride and considered it a win. After all, dealing with such matters with some bun like The Director is difficult even on a good day. 

Later on, Mr. Toes found out that The Director sneered and ridiculed the idea. He ranted and raved about it to his wife. His wife, surprised, thought that it was a splendid idea. The Director knew better than to argue with a Rex and relented. 

The crew slowly started to arrive. Abby and Pancake showed up first. Then Penny, Ava, and Joey. The drew lots to choose who would start the poses, and it was Joey's lucky night. Every bunny helped to clear the room and secure everything to the walls, leaving the ceiling and a side wall unobstructed to let in as much light as possible.

They took their drawings boards and mounted them on gyroscopically stabilized easels. They stepped into foot restraints and adjusted their orientation to the model with tiny thrusters using compressed air. On orbit, you can't sit down and set your board on a bench. You are free-floating, and so is your board. When you press the charcoal against the paper, you are pushing yourself away from it. The easels were equipped with tiny vacuum cleaners for cleaning up the inevitable nebulae of charcoal dust forming above the papers.

They had to work fast because it was not just the model changing its position, but the light shifted at a rapid pace; at least during the sunny part of the orbit. When the planet blocked the sunlight, and the ship was in the shadows, they had about forty-five minutes of a fixed, steady light source. Then, somebun would try to steady the model. It didn't always work exactly to every bun's liking, but they made the best of it. 

Mr. Toes called for a few fifteen-second poses, and Joey froze still. The swish of charcoal and graphite sticks filled the room. As Joey held his pose, he was still turning relative to everybun, so the pose kept changing constantly. The effect was most pronounced when the Sun illuminated him with the flash of orbital sunrise. He went from being lit by a warm white light to getting drenched by a flash of green, then orange and gold, then yellow and finally by the most intense white only a nearby star can produce.

During the next set of poses, each lasting a minute, we did our best trying to do Joey some justice. We were warming up nicely. The challenge always came during the long poses. The process naturally produced pieces that in spirit were aligned with the quantum nature of life. Joey's slow rotation forced the multi planed conundrums of existence to the surface. Microgravity accelerated and forced every bun to deal with the fact that Joey had a back side as well as a profile. Then again, they were used to dealing with the interlocking and shifting challenges of daily living in space. Here, a "Nude Bun Descending the Staircase" was more of a rule rather than an exception. 

In was on orbit where every bun here put a piece of charcoal to paper. They have never had the first paw experience  of the constraints that gravity places on the model.

Before I started this group, I wondered how they would take to this exercise.  On one paw, they were very different from their pit bun ancestors that mined disapprovium, iron, and nickel. On the other paw, these gals and guys were just as tough and accustomed to dealing with extremes. Engineering degrees didn't soften them and they had never pursued anything like this on their own. Outside the confines of this "class," the only quality of line they cared about was how precise the line was and only trusted the mathematical representation of said line. 

It turns out, they enjoyed debating the quality of a line that turned and twisted, grew wider and thinner, disappeared in places tricking the eye to fill the missing fragments. They are quite adept at critiquing each other's efforts and for a change their guts and emotions push their partners in art beyond their limitations. 

Mr. Toes called for another pose change and set the time to three minutes. After a couple of simple poses, Joey assumed the arched position of a skydiver, after that he did a dance pose, then another one, but this time he turned himself upside down relative to the artists.

Pancake joined him toward the end of the session, and they held a couple of pair poses that usually would be considered high action and impossible to hold on earth.
