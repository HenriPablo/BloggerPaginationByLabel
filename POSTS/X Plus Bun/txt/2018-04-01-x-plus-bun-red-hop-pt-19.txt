X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 19

I woke up and sat up at attention. Something had happened, I felt the ship tremble ever so slightly. When I got to the flight deck, Molly and Pancake were in the middle of running some systems' check. "What happened?" I asked, still half asleep. "We're just testing that skid you fixed," answered  Pancake slowly, drawing long pauses between the words paying attention to what she was doing. 

We had tried to make the last day on the surface as light as we could. By the time I got up, Joey was already outside, playing with the loader. ye, Hopmeric was his side. After the morning grooming, noming and ship chores, I dropped in to check on Abby in engine room. Everybunny else was there already. They were sitting and staring at their handy work. The mood was rather somber.
"so, what's left?' I asked. "Run the wires to the flight deck, fasten them to the structure so they don't snap off during the launch," Abby recited grimly and slowly without making any eye contact.
"How are the number looking?" asked Ava quite excitedly, dissipating the glumulonimbus cloud that took over the room. 
"I still have to finish that. Polar orbit OK with you? I can't quite recall how we re-entered. I've no idea. what our inclination was, ten, thirty degrees?" I wondered out loud.
