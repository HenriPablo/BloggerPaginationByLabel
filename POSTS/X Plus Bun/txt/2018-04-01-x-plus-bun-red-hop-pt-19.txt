X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 19

I woke up and sat up at attention. Something had happened, I felt the ship tremble ever so slightly. When I got to the flight deck, Molly and Pancake were in the middle of running some systems' check. "What happened?" I asked, still half asleep. "We're just testing that skid you fixed," answered  Pancake slowly, drawing long pauses between the words paying attention to what she was doing. 

We had tried to make the last day on the surface as light as we could. By the time I got up, Joey was already outside, playing with the loader. Yes, Hopmeric was his side. After the morning grooming, noming, and ship chores, I dropped in to check on Abby in the engine room. Everybunny else was there already. They were sitting and staring at their handy work. The mood was rather somber.
"so, what's left?' I asked. "Run the wires to the flight deck, fasten them to the structure, so they don't snap off during the launch," Abby recited grimly and slowly without making any eye contact.
"How are the numbers looking?" asked Ava quite excitedly, dissipating the glumulonimbus cloud that took over the room. 
"I still have to finish that. Polar orbit OK with you? I can't quite recall how we re-entered. I've no idea. what our inclination was, ten, thirty degrees?" I wondered out loud.
"Neh, it doesn't matter. I think I know where that cloud of debris was; we can use polar orbit if you want. The window we have to hit is very tiny no matter how we get there. I'll help you in a minute," said Abby, slowly coming out of her bad mood.

Well, I went back to my console and prepared everything. All we had left to do was to correct for our exact destination. As I waited for Abby, I took a look outside. Joey was still on the loader with Hopmeric, and they were moving around the leftover stone slabs that we didn't use. Joey was standing them up arranging them around in a circle for some reason.

I put him on the speaker at my console and listened to him for a while, "...cause you have to give it some form, Hop. Hop, how's that stogie? You're not supposed to eat it, just chew on it as I showed you. So we can have some fun with those stone. We could put them up in a pile, but that would be just a pile. You see, if we arrange them in a circle, you gain strong balance and symmetry. And every bunny likes circle. Do like circles, Hop?"

Of course, "Hop" didn't feel like contributing to the conversation. I had to admit though; it would be great to witness Hopmeric's first contribution to any conversation. Then I lost them from view. Joey did care about his "piece" though. He was diligently hauling away the stones from the ship to a safe distance, beyond the reach of our main thrusters during the upcoming launch. Out by the woods, they might survive our take off and give the bipeds something t ponder for centuries to come. And I'll pretend that Hopmeric was the proper co-author of this ... "piece." The conversation on the speaker died down as Joey worked hard talking himself through handling of another slab. This one he placed on the top of some other, like a cross beam. When he turned around to get another one, he came up right to the window. "So, what do you think, Major?" Joey boomed through the speaker. 

The voice was his, but the rest of the sight took a second to used to! He wore his antique, aviator sunglasses; a red bandanna sat on top his head, and the sleeves of his flight suit were tied in a knot around his midriff. And that catnip stogie lit up and hanging out of the corner of his mouf.

He even managed to decorate Hopmeric. the poor beast sat right behind Joey and sported sunglasses as well. chewed up bits and pieces of catnip where stuck all over his mouf. I guessed he either ate the thing or lost it. I had hoped it was the latter. 
"I'm speechless, Joey. When is the Grand Opening; are you going to have a reception?" I laughed. "This evening, Major. Bring a quest!" Joey played along. 

Joey gently turned around the loading dolly and floated away to pick up the next piece of his installation. Underneath his easy-going smile of Joey's hid a ruthless professional. When he picked up the next stone, he was all business even though he was cutting up Hopmeric. As he kept building his tone circle, Joey may as well have been docking them with one another with the exactitude and self-assurance worthy of the most demanding of jobs between the Sun and Pluto.

Abby and the rest snack up on me while I was lost watching Joey work his magic. They stood there for a moment, gaping at the stone circle and listening to Joey make fun of the bipeds. "they'll have something think about for centuries to come, I tell ya, Hop! Mark my word, we could come back here in a thousand years and all they'll keep on oning and oning about it. Hey, how's your stogie there? Oh didn't you lose it again? you want another one?" Joey kept enjoying himself. "major, I tell ya, you gotta tell the others to come out and play. It's such a beautiful day outside!" Joey kept transmitting in the blind.

Pancake stood next to me, shifted her footing and said, "He's got a point, he's got a point, I give him that."
"OK, where are we, Toes?" Abby started herding back to work.

It didn't take us long to make the final calculations. We still had plenty of time ahead of us before the next launch window, so we could have a relaxing evening. We would check everything once more, or twice if it would make us feel better before liftoff. 

Ava and Penny finished running a trigger cable from the reactor to the consoles on the deck, and we installed a pair of toggle switches between two seats in the first and second rows of the consoles. The bun the right or left of each switch could throw it and inject the pressurized cadmium chrono-chromium into the core of the main reactor. All bun had to do was to get ready when the cover of the switch flashed yellow and flip it when the cover flashed red. The window to throw the switch was only a few seconds long so the timing would be critical. Of course, any or all of us could switch it, and only one charge would be introduced into the core. This was just our idea for quadruple redundancy.

The evening was ours after that.
