X-Plus Bun - The Underwater Space Drill
I remember this one story my great grandpa to the Nth power told me about a crew making a deorbit flight. They died because their craft suffered a thermal protection breach in one of the wings. Why would he tell me something like that; right before bedtime; when I was tiny? I would tell a story like that because that's just me, but my great grandpa? That's no way to raise your little ones. As if that wasn't bad enough, he kept scaring us with stories about these mythical creatures called the "hoomins" who inhabited our planet long, long ago and kept us as pets. That's what he would tell us when we wanted nanners instead of hay for dinner, "Eat your hay or the hoomins will get you at night." I'll spare you the recipes.
