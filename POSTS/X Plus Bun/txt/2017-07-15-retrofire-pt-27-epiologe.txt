X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 27 - Epilogue

The deorbit flight always put me on edge, and this one was no different. Maybe Freddie's paranoia rubbed off on me badly enough to make this one feel even worse than any previous return. I remember this one story my great grandpa to the Nth power told me about a crew making a deorbit flight and dying because their craft suffered a thermal protection breach in one of the wings. Why would he tell me something like that, right before bedtime, when I was tiny? I would tell a story like that because that's just me, but my great grandpa? That's no way to raise your little ones. As if that wasn't bad enough, he kept scaring us with stories about these mythical createures called the "hoomins" who inhabited  our planet long, long ago and kep us as pets. That's wh would tellus when we wanted nanners instead of hay for dinner, "Eat your hay or the hoomins will get you at night." I'll spare you the recipes. 

Before we undocked from the Repair Hub, I stopped by the medical bay and checked on Dr. Hopnom. He was coming around and the doctors felt very optimistic about his full recovery. Freddie kept constant guard around him. I have no idea what threats or promises he made to the medical staff, but they tolerated him. We had found out much later that he was not as crazy as we had first imagined. 

Things kept looking up for us. Shortly after our return shuttle performed the deorbit burn, the repair Hub patched in a encrypted message from one of the maintenance vessels around Saturn. It was Beth, check of the Communications Engineering corps. I've not heard her voice in ages.

One of her crafts was out on a mission to refurbish a x-ray relay cluster when her crew discovered something strange. Something had disturbed the orbit of the strucutre and one of its modules was completely off line. for a while the whole thing kept rotating in a strange manner before stabilization system returned it to normal. Eventually its orbit returned to normal, but that one module stayed as dead as a doorknob. Whatever disabled that part of the facility also took out the part of the surveillance system that provided visual of the cluster's exterior. The self repair system didn't even try to repair the damage because to it, the module ceased to exist.

Well, when Beth's crew arrived, the picture cleared up but the mystery deepened. Something crashed into the module and became lodged between the main support trusses. at first they thought it was a piece of rock or a lump of iron and nickel, but that  couldn't be it. In this part of the Solar system, things like that travel much faster and at those velocities, a rock thing big would pulverize clean the entire module. This thing traveled very slowly. the wreckage looked more and more like a bun made object though. Some of its edges were too sharp and clean.

Finally, some bun mentioned the part of our story about sending our old training craft to act as a remote SOS beacon. It didn't take them long to put the two and two together. The mysterious scrap metal turned out our TR-Regis-3 trainer. further analysis of the wreckage revealed that the tiny craft suffered a fatal blow from a micro meteorite long before it go to Saturn.  the impact was gentle enough for the craft to remain intact. But its trajectory was altered enough that it drifted and crossed one of the asteroid belts and became mangeled beyond all recognition.  That's why it turned up so far away from the point we had hoped to park it around Saturn.  

The funny thing is, carbon dating placed the origin of the craft in the carboniferous period. In the end, they were able to scrape enough serial numbers from various bits and pieces of the wreckage to positively identify it as the TR-Regis-3.

Beth closed the message with a promise that she would come by for a visit on the next leave she gets. the news of the recovery of our trainer hit me like a brick. suddenly, I was grieving for the sad hunk of metal. I was grieving for us too, for Mel and Hopper even though we have had come out alive out of this adventure. it made no sense at all. 

The pilot had to prompt me twice for a response when she was going through the re-entry  checklist. I had my sun glare visor closed and no bu could see my face. I waved at them that I was OK, but of course that was not enough. I had to call out my response and I couldn't. The commanger looked at her pilot and stretched her neck to look at me. I finally gurgled a weepy OK through my clenched throat. 

The rest of the return flight was uneventful. Once we came into contact with the atmosphere, all I had to do was to enjoy the plasma show outside the windows. I began to enjoy the pull of gravity. This felt good, this was the real deal and there's  nothing you can do to "turn if off." It has your kister and it won't let go. Honest, organic gravity, the only kind a massive rock, the size of a planet has to offer, and you can feel it in your paws, your chest, and your gut. You appreciate breathing again after a few Gs of a reminder that it can be crushed out of you.

I'm glad to have all that behind me. At least for now. That awareness caused a physical reaction in my chest, one of relief and satisfaction. I pulled another wild strawberry off its stem and nomed it slowly. 

A couple weeks after our return home, a package arrived from Freddie. Wrapped in several layers of newspaper and magazine pages with articles about our Behemoth encounter, were a pair of gloves and booties. They were made from that special, sticky tactile "gecko toe" fabric. I put them on and run outside into our backyard. I took a hold of the trunk of our favorite apple tree and began to climb it. I went up it like a lizard! I found a couple of ripe apples and tossed them to Abby, who was looking at me a bit confused and petrified. She had to wonder if I had finally lost it and this is the day she would have to turn me over to a crew in white lab coasts.

Alas, the most exciting thing that happened that day was the fresh crumb cake we made together. Nothing beast a good apple crumb cake for dinner! After we finished the cake, we had a serious talk. 

I told Abby that I would like to go away for a couple of days. I think she was truly concerned for me. She called Pancake and told her about my plans. Pancake suggested that as long as I tell them exactly where I'm going and when I'm coming back, there's really no point worrying about it. It's not like they could do anything about it anyway. That's the trouble with grown buns, you can't just ground them because you're worried about them.

So here I am, sitting in the conopy of an old readwood tree. It must bave been two hundred fifty, or maybe even three hundred feet tall. Getting up here was an entire adventure  of its own. The climb up  the tree was slow. I had to watch my every step and look for parts of the trunk that were free of moss and liken. I I almost resorted to using a security line, but in the end I just used my paws.  Another tricky part of the climb was remembering which way I went so I could trace my steps on the way down. 

First, I thought that I will try to climb as high as I possibly could, but then I came to a flat spot in the canopy. At the very top, part of the top collapsed and formed the base of a little meadow. It was  a bit rough and scary at first, but it felt very sturdy. My first impression of it was that of giant next. The thought occurred to me that maybe I should run  because if whatever lives here comes back, I would be in for a very bad day. But then I saw the little wold strawberry  patch. I sniffed around for a bit, but found nothing. Nothing but the smell of dirt and rotting leaves missed with intoxicating smell of conifer needles. I got still and listened. Again I header nothing but the wind, mingling  with all those tree tops around me.

I decided to give this spot a chance and settled in for a moment. There was a break in the branches when I looked tot he west and I could tell the Sun would have to pass through that clearing on its way to the sunset. I found a solid branch above me and fastened a safety tether to it. I clasped the carabiner  on the end of the safety line to a loop on the back of my suit. The line had enough slack that I soon forgot about it.  I let Abby know that my climb was done and that I was fine. That was our agreement. I promised I'd let her know I was safe and that is all she wanted.
