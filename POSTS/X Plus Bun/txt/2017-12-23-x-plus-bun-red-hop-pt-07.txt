X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 7

"For a second I thought 'Oh this is just too ridiculous.' But there it was, bare naked bear, running toward our ship. I had never seen a bear like that, with no clothes on, no shoes, just the way momma nature made her. And three little cubs followed her, and they seemed to be in just as dire share as their mother was. Joey and I looked at each other. Should we help them? Should we let them onboard to see what had happened to them? We have seen bears before, usually at the orbital shipyards or on board ships slated for long-duration expeditions. Those crews could build their own craft from scratch if you have them enough raw materials. But these sorry ursai? The four of them vanished from sight as they went under the ship. We decided to do nothing. Whatever happened to those creatures, we didn't want it onboard. I felt awful about that.

Joey was as perplexed as I was and we didn't say anything. After what left like an eternity, the four bears came into view again as they headed back for the woods. Their momma lead they way once more, and the cubs followed her. Or to be more precise, they tried to follow her, more or less, but they were too preoccupied with frolic and mischief to pay any attention to momma. They rolled around, wrestled with one another and generally had a great time since the craft they just investigated didn't pose any danger to them. It was by pure coincidence that they kept on tumbling toward the woods. Finally, momma had enough! She stood up on her hind paws, turned toward her kids and stretched her mouf at them in what had to be horrific, primordial roar. We couldn't  hear it, of course, but I swear I could feel the console under my paw resonate and felt needles shooting through my paws. 

The three little bears got the point and scrambled toward Momma. I guess they knew better than to make her really angry. After they disappeared back in the forest the reminder of the night was uneventful. Joey and I must have fallen asleep in our seats. Next thing I remembered, was Abby shaking my shoulder. I remember Pancake and the other looking at the surveillance video from the previous night. They kept staring at the screen then at, then at the screen and back at us. It went on like that for a while. 

'Year, we have no idea either!' said Joey preemptively. The feral bears horrified everybun. What maligned those unfortunates we may never know. Under normal circumstances, we would probably try to get to the bottom of such a splendid mystery, but we had to tend to our own problems.

After a quick breakfast, Molly and Penny got ready for their reconnaissance flight. We decided it would be safest to test the scooter right over our ship. This way, if something went wrong, they could land nearby and wouldn't have to worry about being too far away. They could still see around for pretty long distance. 

It was a cloudy and chilly morning. The dense fog seemed to drown everything as far as we could see. What a shame, considering the night was so clear. That weather system had to have rolled in fast.

Molly and Penny launched around noon after it became apparent to us we would be socked in for Bun know how long. At least we could test the telemetry and video stream from the scooter. Once we ware in agreement the scooter performed well enough, they rose as high as they could without going into the solid overcast. The ceiling was pretty low anyway so that they couldn't see very far. But we could see the fog was not very uniform, and there were some clear patches. During one of the passes, we noticed a thin line of smoke rising from the ground.

Our heartbeats went up. Without a word Molly and Penny headed for the source of the smoke, keeping their high altitude. At first, we couldn't make out any details in the video stream. The air was too misty, and they were still too high. Then we noticed the altimeter slowly unwinding. Imagery became clearer the lower they went. Now they were directly over the source of the smoke and descending. No bun uttered a sound. We saw Penny's heart rate go through the root, and finally, we heard Molly, 'It's OK,  Penny, just one low pass and we're getting the hay out of here! Are you getting this? ' Asked Molly, sounding bewildered.

'Rog!' snapped Pancake. Somebun thumped, maybe Abby. I felt a sharp pain in my paw. I was ripping the paw rest off my seat. Abby and Pancake took off for the main hatch in the loading bay. Joey and I watched the scooter gaining altitude speed as it headed back toward our ship. For me, it couldn't go fast enough.
