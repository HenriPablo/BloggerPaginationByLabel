Freddie kept looking for signs of some terminal failure that could cause the death of the ship, but there was nothing. Entire systems and subsystems were simply taken off-line, one by one. Not right away or rapidly, but the pattern seemed consistent. 

First, the communication system went quiet. Something methodically powered it down, as if to get it ready for some major maintenance or an overhaul, except no maintenance or repairs followed and it never came back on-line. Next, guidance and navigation disappeared. Attitude control went the same way, hence slowly, the ship began to tumble.

In the end, the operating system disappeared. Somebun or something managed to wipe all the internal systems clean. The activity logs survived because that part was physically isolated and shielded from the "regular"  set of systems on the ship. The logger only observed and recorded what it "saw." It couldn't offer any explanations of what happened. 

When the delirium started taking over our crew, we took a break. We probably should have done that sooner, but the levels of adrenaline we were experiencing took a while to subside. 

The following morning, over some breakfast greens, Abby decided that we should try to stop or at least slow down the drifting craft. As much as we hated the idea of docking with this thing, we would have to stop its drift. Only then could we use our engines at full throttle to put enough force through the center of mass of that ship to slow it down if not bring it to a standstill. Our news buns friends agreed to carry the story, so it was doubly urgent to get a better control of this situation. 

After a good "night's" sleep, Freddie noticed something peculiar in the logs of the ship. The main computer access everything it could that belonged to the fantom crew members. I was certain there was no breakout of any plaque onboard the vessel or anything else like that. No explosion, no meltdowns or catastrophic breach of the hull that would lead to loss of pressure. The crew only existed as a set of data points, a model or a set of models to be exact, for the sole purpose of the main computer having to interact with "them." To the machine "they" were as real as they could be. Just about the only thing the computer couldn't do with them is to bleed them. It monitored their vitals, pretended to empty the litter bins and refilled the hay and salad holders, simulating all those things, of course. But why did it look through their "personal" stuff? Music and book libraries for example. Granted, all those things were available at the Central Library as well, and there was nothing new in what the crew buns enjoyed, but the question remained. What was the purpose of that perusing the machine did?

Getting chummy with the crew on such an intimate level was a first one for us. Did it try to get to know "them" better? Was this part of the original design or did the machine take it upon itself to learn about the crew to such an extent? It showed a particular interest in philosophy and over time stopped accessing materials on any other topic.

I almost choked on a piece of kale biscuit. We kept looking at bun another without saying a word. Finally, Pancake took a  long sip from a beverage pouch and with mouth still half full of carrot tops, said to Freddie: "Are you sure? It stopped on philosophy and didn't access anting on art of any form, or any sciences." 

After a long pause, Freddie came back, "If you ask me, it looks like this thing tried to quiet it's mind - so to speak. First, it turned off all communications system. It had stopped transmitting, and eventually, it had stopped listening. It had gone blind. In the end, it had slowed down its, hm ..., let's call it metabolism, to nothing. I had turned off all renaming systems and became as still as it could, short of dissolving into a quantum soup.  The only system it couldn't touch was the logging. And in the end, maybe it didn't care about it anymore?"

We floated there still and spellbound. Maybe Freddie was right, or maybe the forensic team would prove him silly? The ship would not do anybun any favors in solving its mystery. We had an idea about what the ship had done, but not what it had thought. It took that part of the puzzle with it to the void it thought it had joined.
