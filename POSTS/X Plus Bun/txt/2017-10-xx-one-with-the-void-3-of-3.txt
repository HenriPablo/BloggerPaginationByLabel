X-Plus Bun - One With The Void - Part 3 of 3

Freddie still kept looking for signs of some terminal failure that could cause the death of the ship, but he had found nothing. Entire systems and subsystems were simply taken off-line, one by one. A pattern had emerged in how they went dark. 

After a good "night's" sleep, Freddie noticed something peculiar in the logs of the ship. The main computer access everything it could that belonged to the fantom crew members. The crew only existed as a set of data points, a model or a set of models to be exact, for the sole purpose of the main computer having to interact with "them." At first, to the machine, "they" were as real as they could be. Just about the only thing the computer couldn't do with them was to bleed them. It monitored their vitals, it thought it emptied the litter bins, refilled the hay and salad holders. But why did it start looking through their "personal" stuff? Music and book libraries for example. All those things were available at the Central Library as well, and there was nothing new in what the crew buns enjoyed, but the question remained, what was the purpose of that perusing the machine did?

Getting chummy with the crew on such an intimate level was a first one for us. Did it try to get to know "them" better? Was this part of the original program's or experiment's design or did the machine take it upon itself to learn about the crew? It showed a particular interest in philosophy and over time stopped accessing materials on any other topic.

I almost choked on a piece of kale biscuit. We kept looking at bun another without saying a word. Finally, Pancake took a  long sip from a beverage pouch and with mouth still half full of carrot tops, turned to Freddie: "Are you sure? It stopped on philosophy and didn't access anything on the art of any form, or any sciences, nothing on technology." 

As we sifted through the data, we had come across signs of the ship trying to reach other vessels and facilities. This wasn't your regular telemetry. It scanned all the frequencies it could tune and then tried to initialize contact. Of course, nothing responded. But this did clear up the mystery interrogation our own Buzzard encountered a few months back. Our ship flagged it as a penetration attack. The funny thing was, it didn't look like a penetration attack. The intruder didn't try anything nefarious, and we chalked it up to some kids playing mischief. I remember the crews taking a break at our last stop at a resupply hub talked about something similar.

First, the communication system went quiet. Something methodically powered it down, as if to get it ready for some major maintenance or an overhaul, except no maintenance or repairs followed. Next, guidance and navigation disappeared. Attitude control went the same way, hence over time, the ship began to tumble.



After a long pause, Freddie came back, "If you ask me, it looks like this thing ended up trying to quiet its mind. First, it turned off all communications system. It had stopped transmitting, and eventually, it had stopped listening. It had gone blind. In the end, it had slowed down its, hm ..., let's call it metabolism, to nothing. It had turned off all renaming systems and became as still as it could, short of dissolving into a quantum soup.  The only system it couldn't touch was the logger, and even this one fell silent once the powerplant shut down and the backup fuel cells run dry. In the end, maybe it didn't care about it anymore?"

In the end, the operating system disappeared. Somebun or something managed to wipe clean all the internal systems, and we were left only with the activity logs. The logger observed and recorded what it "saw." It couldn't offer any explanations of what had happened. 

We were spending a lot of time in silence. After a while,  there was just nothing to say. We kept staring at the data, and after a while, we were not sure anymore what we were looking for. We were just afraid to miss "it" even though no bun was sure what "it" was. Suddenly, Molly stirred as she reached  for her sippy bag and said, "This is starting to read like a dairy." She sipped a gulp and floated toward the litter and supply lockers. "Bring you a snack, any bunny?" No bun answered.
"No, this is not a dairy anymore, it's a more of an obituary or a remembrance piece," said Ava.

When the delirium started taking over our crew, we took a break. We probably should have done it sooner, but the levels of adrenaline we were experiencing took a while to subside. 

The following morning, over some breakfast greens, Abby decided that we should try to stop or at least slow down the drifting craft. Our news buns friends agreed to carry the story, so it was doubly urgent to get a better control of this situation. We had found ourselves in the midst of a difficult debate. Do we try to stop the sip with our engines, do let it go entirely, or do we try to power up the main engines on the drifter and use them to stop the craft? 

Abby wanted to let it all go. We were drifting along with the ship and sooner rather than later we would have to think about heading for home. She was getting cranky and snappy about it too. She didn't pull rank yet, but I had a feeling she was close to it. Ava and Penny stayed neutral, but Pancake insisted on staying with the craft. The news buns could rendezvous with us soon if we slowed down this thing ever a little bit. Joey was all none too pleased. He wasn't getting gEBA anyway. Hea excused himself and said that he would be busy with maintenance in the engine room. Freddie begged for a chance to power up the engines of the drifter. He claimed he only needed a couple more hours at this point because the crew of his Morsel were working the problem from the beginning and were close to having a good hack on the procedure to power up the engines. 

Abby relented a little. Her eyes were red and puffy. The fur on her mouf had started to get fleecy from the frequent washing and rubbing. I have not seen her like this in a long, long time. She turned the command over to Pancake and went to get a nap. Pancake's first on her shift was simple, "Listen up, every bunny go and get some sleep. One of you can stay with me, but that is all. We have two ships to take care of now, so you better disappear and take care of you for a bit!"

Next morning at breakfast we were all quiet. Trying to get some sleep never works as well as getting some proper sleep. Mix in a puzzle like the one we had been trying to decipher and everything starts to blur. We were tired. 

talk about the news buns


We floated there, still and spellbound. Maybe Freddie was right, or maybe the forensic team would prove him silly? The ship would not do anybun any favors in solving its mysteries. We had an idea about what the ship had done, but not what it had thought. It took that part of the puzzle with it to the void it thought it had joined.
