X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 13

No bun slept much that night, even poor Hopper. We stuck out our heads from the burrow-bags and looked at bun another. No bun wanted to be the first bun out. I broke the stalemate, "Mel: breakfast! Hopper, you and me: suit prep!" The hopping orders were out. I caught four stink eyes for it. T lead the way, crawled out first and stretched. mel grumbled off prep food. Hopper I grabbed a couple of sippy bags and floated toward the flight deck and did a quick check of the ship. All readings came back nominal. I missed this place so much; I felt like I could come undone at any moment.  I thought that if this works and I get to go home in one piece, I'll be going off into the woods for a very long time.

We started inspecting the suits when Mel called with food. I did feel hungry and I took it as a good sign. We started with a little bit of recovery food mix, then had reconstituted fresh  grass and a load of hay. Finished off with a little more recovery food mix. No bun said much that morning. I did my best to not make any cracks about the last  breakfast and other jokes of such ilk.

"OK, everybun, last call for the litter bin!" called Hopper. We took our turns and then turned our attention to the departure checklist. Just as we called out the last item on the list, another orbital sunrise flooded the cabin to great us.

This time, the suit up went without a hitch. Hopper was steadfast and went about the routine like an old paw. He didn't rush, he didn't hesitate. So  did Mel. Was it stoic resignation; certainty? I know we didn't have any of the latter.

After the helmets were on, and final pressure checks were d one, we headed for the airlock. We had commenced our final Extra Bunnicular Activity. Once we were out of our craft and inside the Behemoth, Mel remotely initiated orbit adjustment of our craft. We wanted it raised above the Behemoth and definitely above and away from its deadly  rear. Just in case, we didn't  want the Behemoth blasting away our little vessel when we leave here. In a few hours, our little trainer would be on its way to Saturn. If our plan didn't work and the next time we stick our heads from the Behemoth, we want to see that little craft and we'll have to make the best of our terrible "Plan B." Ferns and arthropods would have to do. I wouldn't mind that so much, if I could write a book about it,  "Mr. Toes and the Arthropods", but who would read it? 

I had my paw on wall of the corridor in the Behemoth and briefly left it vibrate as the orbital maneuvering thrusters blasted away. For a moment we went back out side to visually confirm our craft moved away. Indeed, if floated above us and I hoped, safely far away. 

we were all tethered for this part of our excursion and we had our auxiliary life  support module and the flight recorders in tow. It was a slow and awkward journey to the command center of the Behemoth. At last, once we got there, all seemed undisturbed since yesterday. We left our cargo in the corridor and proceeded to the three formations.

I grabbed hopper and Mel by the sleeves of their suits and asked them if they are still good to go through with this experiment. both said "Yes."

Hopper moved in on the center celestial model and took a hold of it with both paws. It had a surprisingly solid feel to it, as if encased in a clear, solid substance. He compressed it with both paws. the formation was analogous to our current location in time-space. Hopper continued to compress and shrink the object until it was tiny and fit in his paw, until it disappeared. 

Mel took to the object on our right and reduced it to the size of a strawberry. We all moved over to the one remaining model, the one representing our time-space origin. We stayed there, watching it. Mel was supposed to place the destination model right in the middle of our origin. This was our new coordinates command.

Mel, we're ready when you are. do you want me to do it? I asked, nudging him.

He place his strawberry like pebble in the middle of the large model, pressed on it and floated back a little. 

At first we thought that nothing had happened. I remember a quick squeeze my gut, but otherwise I felt fine. I looked at hopper but he was just looking at the model. Then, suddenly our light flickered, went out, and came back on again. The chamber gave off a pulse of faint light and returned back to its dark self. my suit, went dead again, just like the other day when the Behemoth flash-synced with us. I calmly cycled the suit and it came back on after a while. I saw the light of Mel and Hopper's suits come back on too. 

"Well, here we go, again, Major" said Hopper looking at me. 
"Now what?" wondered Mel. I think we all knew the answer to that. My feet and ears got flushed.
"Look at this!" I said, tapping Mel's visor. His location coordinates were turning green. At first I though that maybe this was just his suit still trying to run self tests, but mine started doing the same thing. Just how good a sign was this?
"Gentlebuns, turn on your location transmitters, please." I said trying to keep my voice low. The little red indicator lights began to blink lazily. 
"Let's move toward the exit. " I commanded. The behemoth might still be shielding our signal. If we got outside, we might improve our signal. 

As we moved back through he corridor toward the airlock,  my radio started to crackle and the time display flickered and turned green, showing  a proper date! I saw Mel up ahead turned toward me and gave me two thumbs up.
"Hurry up, Hopper, will you!" I yelled laughing. Hopper was leading the way  and he couldn't move fast enough for my taste! We were picking up a lot of frantic radio traffic, as if something had happened out thee. Oh, wait,  indeed, he had happened. The  external signal was getting clearer and clearer. Once we got to the airlock and Hopper pulled it open, we went outside. Our training craft was gone. We were looking out at the open space, but we were illuminated by the sun in its harsh, unfiltered glory. the Center frequency was abuzz  with activity. somebun was announcing the loss of contact with our craft, then somebun was yelling that the craft was gone. I looked at my emergency transmitter. it was transmitting OK, but was any bunny listening?

"Center, this TR Regis 3, requesting assistance, three survivors." I announced on the emergency frequency. No bun responded. I kept repeating the message, but no bun responded. Then the Center announced they were picking up emergency locator signals, and asked who can proceed tot he given location some maintenance craft responded and said they were proceeding to investigate.  They just launched and were in the best position to rendezvous with us. but no bun acknowledge my calls yet. 

"Major, I'm ready to stat cursing , do you think they'll notice?" asked Hopper sounding aggravated.
