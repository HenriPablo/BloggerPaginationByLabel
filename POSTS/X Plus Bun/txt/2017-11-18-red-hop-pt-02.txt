X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 2

The clock hit zero. There's not much we can do now. The Cap Com  confirms it, laconically, without the hint of panic my biom is starting to feel. I keep one ye on the control panel and one of Zoomer. Neither of us can mess up thispart too much. The worst that could happen is that Zoomer's paw might get twitchy, she pulls the abort handle and we are done. We might end up dead. A small rocket mounted on top of our capsule would fire, the main prachute would hopefully open and we would be on the ground shortly. We would be done, and Zoomer would be done witht her commission. She could fly kites after that, on her own time and dime, of course. Thus, for the moment, doing nothing is considered a satisfactory performance. We watch the gages showing the main engnes come up to half power, then three quarter, and finally hunder percent. Just as important are the supporting gages that could betray the first signs of stress onthe engine that exceed the saftey limits. 

Zoomer keeps her cool and so do the engines. That's a really good news. I saw one of those engine assemblies melt during a test.
