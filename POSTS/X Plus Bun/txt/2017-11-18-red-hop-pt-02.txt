X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 2

The clock hit zero. There's not much we can do now. The Cap Com confirms it, laconically, without the hint of panic my biom is starting to feel. I keep one eye on the control panel and one of Zoomer. Neither of us can mess up this part too much. The worst that could happen is that Zoomer's paw might get twitchy, she pulls the abort handle, and we are done. We might end up dead. A small rocket mounted on top of our capsule would fire, the main parachute would hopefully open, and we would be on the ground shortly. We would be done, and Zoomer would be done with her commission. She could fly kites after that, on her own time and dime, of course. Thus, for the moment, doing nothing is considered a satisfactory performance. We watch the gages showing the main engines come up to half power, then three quarter, and finally hundred percent. Just as important are the supporting gages that could betray the first signs of stress on the engine that exceed the safety limits. 

Zoomer keeps her cool, and so do the engines. That's excellent news. I saw one of those engine assemblies melt during a test. When one of the flights aborted before liftoff due to overheating power coil, the decided to stress test to failure that entire set up. From time to time they do that to engines at half of their service lifetime, just to test engineering expectations against the realities engines face during their service in the fleet. 

That was a spectacular display of angry, vicious, molten metal, ceramic and composite, evaporating, flying in all directions and raining calamity on everybun around. Some rex in a yellow hard hat next tome got half his ear blown off. The good news was, that didn't happen to a crew during the launch. 

This time, everything is in green, and my gut check agrees. Even my bum, clad in a bulky pressure suit and sitting on a shock absorbent couch feels that the engines are running just right. With the power plant running so smoothly, you might forget there is a raging, hot catastrophe punishing the ground below and just then acceleration steps in to remind you that this is for keeps. It's becoming harder and harder to move a paw and something pushing me into the couch. Something is trying to pull the muscles off my body into a puddle of flesh, and it's getting harder to breathe. That's when I start to appreciate the genius of my couch. I feel pressed into the capsule and become one with it in a perfect fit. Every part of me feels welded to the ship by the G-forces, yet the exact fit feels comforting, even my chin feels like it found the precisely right spot to rest in this beast.

I keep watching Zoomer. We had cleared the tower a while back and time and altitude are starting to be on our side. The pressure caused by the hard acceleration easer somewhat, but that's enough to bring on a significant relief. I finally noticed the Cap Com running a commentary and being overly reassuring. I realized he's grating on my nerves. Is he getting chummy with Zoomer or something? Zoomer is smiling though, and I think she is entirely oblivious to the trying-too-hard Cap Com. 

In a few minutes, the little window in front of us turned completely black. Another moment and the engines cut out, and I felt myself lifting off the couch. The top of my head and my back jerked upwards, relatively speaking, and the helmet and the suit held me in place. It was a violent jolt, a jarring goodbye from the booster letting us know that we were on our own; for now. All the pressure on my body disappeared, and I felt suspended in the cocoon of the suit. 

We got very busy after that with a lot of housekeeping chores. We had to make sure we had no leaks and got a confirmation from the ground. We had to verify the radiation protection system as well. Only after we did all that we were able to take off our bubble helmets and get out of the suits. Zoomer did seem distraught, she was adjusting to the new environment pretty well, but I still spend most of my time watching over her. She tried to scratch her ears a couple of times, and it looked like she was convulsing. After a couple of tries, she figured out that she would have to put one foot in a restraint and use the other one to scratch. Then she would have to switch again to get the other ear. I have to admin; those are the simple pleasures in life that never get old, the rookies trying to figure out how to do things that never required any thought, unlit orbit. 

Once the chores were under control, we rotated the couches on their rear hinges to a position where they were pointing toward the nose of the capsule. When they locked into their new positions, we could use them as seats with restraints or even beds. Half of their top covers acted like big pockets and made of elastic fabric. A bun could crawl into one, and during sleep, the pocket would "hug" one to the cushion.
