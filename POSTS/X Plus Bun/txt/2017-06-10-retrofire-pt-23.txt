X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 23

The commander of the resupply ship made several attempt to dock with the hospital and gave up. The hospital oscillated beyond what the docking computer could handle. The docking fiasco kept the commander on edge, and he started snapping at his pilot for no good reason at all. Freddie spike up form the reak of the flight deck about using the flex-dock from the hospital. The commander looked taken aback. It took him a moment to process the idea and then snapped at Freddie to have a tit. The commander ordered all personnel to the cargo bay to work on getting the cryo-pods prepared for transfer to the hospital.

During the brief shuffle on the deck, Freddie turned to Penny and asked her to rummage for a tranquilizer gun in the crebun's medical supply locker. Freddie's bad feeling about this adventure got worse. He wondered about th crew of this ship. The fact that he had to tell them about the flex-dock completely sunk his mood. But he kept his cool and started to reposition the ship a few meters to his left to line up the vessel with the location of the flex-dock of the hospital. Freddie watched as the hospital module moved up and down, like a ship in heavy seas. He activated the flex-dock  and watched on a monitor how a large tube with a docking collar extended toward the ship. The collar sensed the location of the docking station on the ship and with the help of small thrusters kept itself steady relative to the ship. Then a gentle shudder went through the ship as the collar made contact with the craft and stuck to it like a leech. Slowly, it worked its way precisely to lock on the craft's dock. Freddie watched how the tube connecting the ship with the hospital flexed and waved. After another moment the ship signaled it had a clean seal withe he flex-dock.

The commander growled at Freddie and ordered him to go the cargo bay. Freddie froze in place. Then, a loud noise from the intercom filled the flight deck. It startled everybun, even the commander. At first Freddie recognized that it was the S.O.S. signal from the hospital. At that time, he had no idea it was coming from the module where Mel, Hopper and I were hiding. In the next instance Freddie recognized my voice yelling something.

The commander moved toward Freddie, but before he could get withing paw's length of Freddie, his eyes glazed over and he became motionless. From behind the commander's limp body emerged Penny. She was holding a spent tranquilizer injector. Her paw was shaking, her mouf trembled. The still body of the commander floated ever so slowly toward Freddie and Freddie gently pushed him to the side.

Somebun in the hospital still had a stuck mike and the sounds of the scuffle continued to fill the flight deck. Finally, the fight died down and an unfamiliar voice declared that the auxiliary command station of the st. Cinnamon's hospital was secured and the three "patients" were neutralized. Freddie pushed off from
the seat and moved toward a control panel the cargo bays. He punched in a command on a keypad and displayed a video  stream from the cargo bay holding the cryo-pods. The crew were trying to get the pods ready for transport to the hospital. They untied the last pod and were ready to move. Freddie punched in code to blow the cargo door of the bay. He paused for a while and pictured everybun getting sucked out into the void of space, cryo-pods, badgers, and rexes, all would be gone in a matter of seconds. He couldn't get the sound of the fight in the hospital out of his head; especially the silence when fight was over. He was fine with blowing out the bay door.

Penny noticed what was going on. she floated tot he console and hit the "cancel" button. She grabbed Freddie by the paw and dragged him away and toward the EBA suit locker. Freddie felt numb and was glad to follow orders. He slipped into a generic, dirty suit. Penny helped him put on a helmet and started the pressure check routine. Penny suited up herself and grabbed a bail of tether line.

What Penny Freddie heard on the flight deck, was the ending our attempt to take over the auxiliary command station of the hospital. It all started well enough. We encountered no bu on our way to it. and let ourselves become convinced that this module was abandoned or already evacuated. As soon as we got to the control panels, Mel initialized the breakup of the station. The hospital was reaching a breaking point anyway and the automated safety system would trigger the module separation on its own. We  just didn't want to wait for it. If they security squad was coming for us, we would make them work and pay for every inch of distance between us and them.  Hopper and I got to work on the radio. We couldn't transmit and it took us a while to realize that the system was already locked down; we had to crack it. We finally got the S.O.S.  broadcasting again, and we requested evacuation assistance.

We were so absorbed in the radio work, that none of us saw the two badgers sneak in to the control room. Poor Mel. He was strapped into the seat as he tried to stabilize the module we were in.  Until he did that no ship could dock with us. They got him first; with a tranquilizer, in the neck. They almost go Hopper too, but the badger missed. I lunged toward him and took a good swing at his lower belly with my flashlight. The badger groaned and folder in half. Hopper got him in the head with a helmet. That's when Hopper  caught a dart in the lg. Before he passed out, he pitched battery at the badger's head and got him right between the eyes. I took a swing at the  badger's noggin with my flashlight again and cleaned his clock. I think I cracked his bell. I turned around check on my guys. I was convinced the place was safe now. I closed and locked the door to the room. I felt a little sting in my back. It made no sense! I'm still not sure where the third badger came from. I got so sleepy...
