X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 23

The commander of the resupply ship made several attempts to dock with the hospital and gave up. The hospital oscillated beyond what the docking computer could handle. The docking fiasco kept the commander on edge, and he started snapping at his pilot for no good reason at all. Freddie spoke up form the rear of the flight deck about using the flex-dock from the hospital. The commander looked taken aback. It took him a moment to process the idea and then snapped at Freddie to have at it. The commander ordered all personnel to the cargo bay to work on getting the cryo-pods prepared for transfer to the hospital.

During the brief shuffle on the deck, Freddie turned to Penny and asked her to rummage for a tranquilizer gun in the corpsbun's medical supply locker. Freddie's bad feeling about this adventure got worse. He wondered about the crew of this ship. The fact that he had to tell them about the flex-dock completely sunk his mood. But he kept his cool and started to reposition the ship a few meters to his left to line up the vessel with the location of the flex-dock of the hospital. Freddie watched as the hospital module moved up and down, like a ship in heavy seas. He activated the flex-dock and watched on a monitor how a large tube with a docking collar extended toward the ship. The collar sensed the location of the docking station on the ship and with the help of small thrusters kept itself steady relative to the ship. Then a gentle shudder went through the ship as the collar made contact with the craft and stuck to it like a leech. Slowly, it worked its way precisely to lock on the craft's dock. Freddie watched how the tube connecting the ship with the hospital flexed and waved. After another moment the ship signaled it had a clean seal with the flex-dock.

The commander growled at Freddie and ordered him to go the cargo bay. Freddie froze in place. Then, a loud noise from the intercom filled the flight deck. It spooked everybun, even the commander. At first, Freddie recognized that it was the S.O.S. signal from the hospital. At that time, he had no idea it was coming from the module where Mel, Hopper and I were hiding. In the next instance, Freddie recognized my voice yelling something.

The commander moved toward Freddie, but before he could get withing paw's length of Freddie, his eyes glazed over and he became motionless. From behind the commander's limp body emerged Penny. She was holding a spent tranquilizer injector. Her paw was shaking, her mouf trembled. The still body of the commander floated ever so slowly toward Freddie and Freddie gently pushed him to the side.

Somebun in the hospital still had a stuck mike, and the sounds of the scuffle continued to fill the flight deck. Finally, the fight died down, and an unfamiliar voice declared that the auxiliary command station of the St. Cinnamon's hospital was secured, and the three "patients" were neutralized. Freddie pushed off from
the seat and moved toward a control panel the cargo bays. He punched in a command on a keypad and displayed a video stream from the cargo bay holding the cryo-pods. The crew was trying to get the pods ready for transport to the hospital. They untied the last pod and were ready to move. Freddie punched in the code to blow the cargo door of the bay. He paused for a while and pictured everybun getting sucked out into the void of space, cryo-pods, badgers, and rexes, all would be gone in a matter of seconds. He couldn't get the sound of the fight in the hospital out of his head; especially the silence when the fight was over. He was fine with blowing out the bay door.

Penny noticed what was going on. She floated to the console and hit the "cancel" button. She grabbed Freddie by the paw and dragged him away and toward the EBA suit locker. Freddie felt numb and was glad to follow orders. He slipped into a generic, dirty suit. Penny helped him put on a helmet and started the pressure check routine. Penny suited up herself and grabbed a bail of tether line.

What Penny Freddie heard on the flight deck, was the ending our attempt to take over the auxiliary command station of the hospital. It all started well enough. We encountered no bun on our way to it, and let ourselves become convinced that this module was abandoned or already evacuated. As soon as we got to the control panels, Mel initialized the breakup of the station. The hospital was reaching a breaking point anyway, and the automated safety system would trigger the module separation on its own. We just didn't want to wait for it. If the security squad was coming for us, we would make them work and pay for every inch of distance between them and us.  Hopper and I got to work on the radio. We couldn't transmit, and it took us a while to realize that the system was already locked down; we had to crack it. We finally got the S.O.S.  broadcasting again, and we requested evacuation assistance.

We were so absorbed in the radio work that none of us saw the two badgers sneak into the control room. Poor Mel. He was strapped into the seat as he tried to stabilize the module we were in.  Until he did that no ship could dock with us. They got him first; with a tranquilizer, in the neck. They almost go Hopper too, but the badger missed. I lunged toward him and took a good swing at his lower belly with my flashlight. The badger groaned and folded in half. Hopper got him in the head with a helmet. That's when Hopper caught a dart in the leg. Before he passed out, he pitched battery at the badger's head and got him right between the eyes. I took a swing at the badger's noggin with my flashlight again and cleaned his clock. I think I cracked his bell. I turned around to check on my guys. I was convinced the place was safe now. I closed and locked the door to the room. I felt a little sting in my back. It made no sense! I'm still not sure where the third badger came from. I got so sleepy...

At about the same time I went down, Freddie and Penny rushed of the airlock and the flex-dock collar. Freddie held on to one end of the tether line, and Penny made her way across the dock to the airlock on the hospital side of it. Freddie released the supply ship from the dock and triggered the maneuvering thrusters to ever so gently push the ship away from the hospital. By now, every bunny working in the cargo bay had to have had the realization that something was amiss. Freddie took out a tube of welding epoxy from a pocket on his suit and applied a good dollop of it on the joins of three docking latches outside the airlock. As the separation of the supply ship from the hospital grew, he pulled himself by the tether line into the flex-dock. He worked as hard as he could to cover the short distance to Penny. Once he made it safely across, he and Penny released the flex-dock from the hospital and pushed it away. 

After they got inside the hospital, Freddie and Penny carefully moved toward the control room. Since they didn't know if any or how many security personnel was left in this module of the station, they moved slowly, hyper alert for any signs of trouble. They heard a dull clank and felt the module shudder. Freddie's heart sunk. Something docked with this section. He had no means of checking who docked and was convinced it was the supply ship getting its act together again to perform an abordage. Freddie had hoped he had gotten him and Penny than this.

"Don't stop now, Freddie!" yelled Penny. "We can seal the control room and depressurize the module. Let's just hope that they get our of their pressure suits, whoever they are." continued Penny.

Freddie and Penny approached the control room very slowly and quietly. They still didn't see any security staff. They peaked through the door window into the room. There was only one badger, trying Toes and Hopper together. Penny armed her tranquilizer gun. She moved to the gap between the door and the wall, aimed and pulled the trigger. Freddie held her back as she started to flat back from the recoil. The startled badger grabbed his neck and turned around. He pushed off toward Penny, but by the time he reached the door, he was in no shape to inflict anything on any bunny. His limp body hit the door and slowly bounced back. 

Penny and Freddie got into the room and sealed the door. Freddie looked for a console trying to identify what had just docked with the module. After a moment, he yelled to Penny, "Look at this!It's not the resupply ship. Penny didn't pay any attention though. She was busy untying Hopper and Toes. 

"That's good, now, give me a paw here, will you?" asked Penny. Freddie floated over, and Penny pointed to the seat where Mel was sitting still and unresponsive. Freddie floated over to him and checked his pulse. The guy was OK; he was just out cold. 

Somebun was banging on the door window; Penny and Freddie jumped and almost suffered heart attacks.
