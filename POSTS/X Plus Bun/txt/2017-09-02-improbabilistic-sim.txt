X-Plus Bun - The Improbabilistic Sim

The mockup resembled a head of a beast. It looked like giant fish head rather then a spacecraft. And what happened to the rest of this fish? I moved forward  partly with apprehension, partly with confidence.  I had been following Abby, marching right in front of me. I give the giant fish head a credit for my anxiety and Abby for a n\my false sense of security. I had asked myself how did Abby end up in this mess? I had no answer. After all, it was my friend at the department of Theoretical Archeo-Engineering that had talked me into volunteering for this experiment. Part of me felt like I've seen all of this before and part of me couldn't quite figure out which way was up or east, or west.

The sim had an elongated nose, rounded off, not very shart, and not blunt either. On the very top of this "head" were a several windows, two of which almost focused forward, so the mockup had the appearance of starign at us. I felt confused even more as the object seemed to be both familiar and strange at the same time. Abby stopped in place in front of me and I almost run into her. she was looking at the ... face of that ... creature, three stories high.
