X-Plus Bun - The Improbabilistic Sim

The mockup resembled a head of a beast. It looked like giant fish head rather then a spacecraft. And what happened to the rest of this fish? I moved forward  partly with apprehension, partly with confidence.  I had been following Abby, marching right in front of me. I give the giant fish head a credit for my anxiety and Abby for a n\my false sense of security. I had asked myself how did Abby end up in this mess? I had no answer. After all, it was my friend at the department of Theoretical Archeo-Engineering that had talked me into volunteering for this experiment. Part of me felt like I've seen all of this before and part of me couldn't quite figure out which way was up or east, or west.

The sim had an elongated nose, rounded off, not very shart, and not blunt either. On the very top of this "head" were a several windows, two of which almost focused forward, so the mockup had the appearance of starign at us. I felt confused even more as the object seemed to be both familiar and strange at the same time. Abby stopped in place in front of me and I almost run into her. she was looking at the ... face of that ... creature, three stories high.

For a moment I questioned my decision to go along with this experiment, eyt I was certain I wouldn't be able to get out of it. When my friend at the Colleage of Theoretical Archeo-Engineering asked me to help with their project I thought nothing of it. What could be the worst that could happen? I would probably kill a couple of weekends reading some very important papers and that would be it. I learned later that the engineers and students from the aerospace Cathedral wre involved too. Almost on a dare. They were just morbidly curious what the historians came up with could be build. 

The historians wondered, quite seriously, if  certain type of mythical createures could develop spae faring capabiliteis. With the help of several departments, they had ended up with the design and mock up staring us in the face. I stood there for a moment, gaping at the bulky head, while Abby marched none chalantly toward the creature.

We ingressed throug a round opening on the port side of the simulator and entered something of a spacious room. I guess the space served as crew quarters or a storage space. I could see how this could be sued for experiments as well.  I'll never forget my first day at that sim and the time I saw what the historians and engineers came up with for a bathroom. Maybe they were running log on funding for this project, or maybe somebun had uncontrollable comedir tendencies. We may never know. The onboard latrine was build into a tall locker. When I looked inside I saw pretty standard space litter bin. The only trouble was, it was designed to accomodate pellets the size of my head. Somebun had to be full of it indeed.

There were two aluminum ladders, on each side of the first deck, leading up to the flight deck on the second level. The space was tight and moving through the opening  to the deck was awkward. It got easier over time but never became comfortable. 

Abby was already strapped into the commander's seat, checklist in paw, starting about her routine. I tried to pick up my pace and ended up knocking my heard on the seat, or the overhead switch panels. It never failed, the faster I tried to move, the slower I went. But eventually I would find myself sitting in the pilot's seat, strapped in, with he headset on.

We would try  to go through the normal approach and landing profile. It was a strange bird, that required about thirty degrees nose down pitch attitude during the approach.
