Greetings Everybunny!

We are still working on the last episode of the "Retrofire" series. It is getting a bit long, bu the nature of the episode is such that it makes no sense to break it up into two parts. We thought we could take the loose ends and wrap them up, but the ends had different ideas. They started to wiggle, took on lives of their own almost got away.

However, it looks like we will be able to wrap up the longhand version tonight and we will be ready to post next week. Of course, we have to think about the doodles that will go with the story ;-)
