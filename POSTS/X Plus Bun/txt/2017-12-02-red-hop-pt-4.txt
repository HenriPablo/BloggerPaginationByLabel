X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 4

We had floated still for a moment, stunned by what we had heard. Zoomer looked at me in disbelief, perhaps expecting me to have an explanation for what was going on, no matter what the center said. My head swirled with confusion. I had a hunch that we had a bigger problem on our paws than the malfunctioning booster. "This is not exactly out of the book, is it?" Zoomer wondered quietly. "How do you think those books get written?" I asked.

Zoomer got on the console and started looking through the logs. "Pay attention to the times when we were asleep, please." I asked. Zoomer raised her eyebrows at me. "Center what did you do when we weren't watching?" I asked the Cap Com, trying to sound sweet and coy as if I had caught red-handed a couple of friendly pranksters in the act. 
"Red Hop One, standby, we are looking into this," responded Cap Com, genuinely puzzled. "Zoomer, that first night I couldn't sleep, I heard them talking about deploying updates without notifying the crews," I said. 
"I don't see any activities in the logs, only that you look that usual telemetry, but nothing out of the ordinary," said Zoomer without taking her eyes off the console. "I don't think they touched anything here, but I'm not that sure about the booster, "Major I think we need to prep for the orbit," said Zoomer. 
"Are you thinking or commanding?" I snapped. 
"Suit up Major, I will configure the ship for deorbit!" said Zoomer, still sounding shaky. I smiled and kept motioning with my right pow for her to keep going. "Major, get the suits ready now!" growled Zoomer from her gut. It still came out awkward, but she meant it. I dove toward the storage lockers on the floor got out our suits. The electric motor in the pilot's couch announced the changing of its configuration. I waited for it to come down and lock in place. That allowed me to get our suits above it so Zoomer could lower that commander's couch. I got her suit out of its protective bag while she prepared for the burn. Next, I stowed that little bunletts' science experiment and secured it in a locker. Cleaning any floating rubbish came next. Whatever got caught by or stock to the air filters went into the trash bin. I looked like a busy space maid, but the chores gave me something simple to do and freed me up to process our current situation. Some electric motor came to life in the capsule, and it took me a second to realize it was the commander's couch changing into its landing configuration. 

"Major!" yelled Zoomer, "... the center is taking inventory of our consumables." "Great, they are trying to figure out how long we can last here," I responded grimly.
"What if we killed our bio-telemetry?" giggled Zoomer. 
"I will write you up for an exceptionally dark sense of humor, sort of like the blackest of black that you see outside," I said what the most deadpan mouf I could muster, but Zoomer wasn't looking.

After a while, she left the console and floated down to the couches, and we started prepping our suits. "Major, I did the final platform alignment and loaded the retrofire burn data, the center is verifying my numbers. We can leave here whenever we want to. The only thing we need to decide is where we want to land." announced Zoomer. 
"Right, sounds great, except we have that leech of a booster stuck to us. I winged.

A call from the center put an end to our banter, "Red Hop One, we have some options for you." My pow tightened on the rim of my helmet while I buffed its clear bubble.
