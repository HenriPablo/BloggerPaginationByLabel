X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 4

We had floated still for a moment, what we had heard. Zoomer looked at me in disbelief, perhaps expecting me to have some sort of an explanation what is going on, no matter what the center says. My head swirled with confusion. I had a hunch that there was a bigger problem on our pause the malfunctioning booster. "This is not exactly out of the book, is it?" Zoomer wondered quietly. "How do you think those books get written?" I asked.

Zoomer. On the console good looking through our ships logs. Pay attention to the times when we were asleep, I asked. Zoomer raised her eyebrows at me., center what did you do watching? I asked cop com, trying to sound sweet and koi I had caught them red-handed a couple of friendly pranksters in the act. Red Hop one,, standby are looking into this. Cop com, genuinely puzzled., zoomer that first night I couldn't sleep I heard them talking about deploying updates without notifying The Croods. I said. I don't see any activities in the logs, only that you look that usual telemetry, nothing out of the ordinary. Set Zoomer without taking her eyes off the console. I don't think they touched anything here but I'm not that sure about the booster, major I think we need to prep for the orbit, said Zoomer. Are you thinking or commanding?. I snapped, sudep nature I will configure the ship for! Set Zoomer sounding shaky. I smiled and kept motioning with my right pole for her to keep going. Major, get the suits ready now! Gravel Zoomer from herget. Still came out Accord, but she meant it. I don't told that storage lockers on the floor got out our suits. The electric motor in the pilots couch announced the changing configuration. To come down and lock in place. That allowed me to get our suits zoomer could lower that sanders couch. I got her suit out of its protective bag she prepared for the burn., next, I told that little band let's science experiment secured it in a locker. Cleaning Annie floating rubbish. Whatever got caught by or talk to the air filters into trash bag. I looked like a busy space made, chores gave me something simple to do freed me up to process our current situation. Some electric motor to life in the capsule and it took me a second to realize it was the Commander's couch into its lending configuration.! Major, the center is taking inventory of our consumables. Great, they are trying to figure out how long we can last here. I responded grimly.

What if we build our bio elementary? Giggled Zoomer. I will write you up for an exceptionally dark sense of humor, sort of like the blackest of black that you see outside. I said what the most pain mouth mustard, but summer wasn't looking.

After a while she left the floated down to the couches we started prepping our suits. Major, I did the final platform alignment and looked the Retro fire burn, the center is verifying my numbers. Leave here we want . The only thing we need to decide is where we want to land announced Zoomer. Right, sounds great, we have that leech of a booster stock to us. I winched.

A call from the center put an end to our banter, red Hop one, we have some options for you. My poor tightened on the rim of my helmet while I buffed it's clear bubble.
