X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 12

First thing in the morning, we worked on making a checklist for the evacuation. I didn't mention that we had no printer to print the checklist.  It was the rehearsal I wanted us to go through. We we got done, Hopper looked at me with a frown when his "no-printer" light went on. 

- MAKING OF HOPPER'S GLOVES - 
Next, we had to find some copper wire. Mel got the idea that we can use any of the connector cables from the data recorder compartment. So we did. Stripping the nano-carbon insulation was a tedious job. The wire was of a very fine gage and the thin strands tore easily. We chased the little pieces that broke off because we couldn't trust the ventilation system picking up all of them before they could get stuck in switches and such. Vermin like that will get into all the nooks and crannies, and all the other spots you don't want it in. Believe, It's happened before. We don't have anybun on the ground to write us subroutines for bypassing faulty buttons.

When we had enough of the strands, Mel go the epoxy glue from the suit repair kit. I put on the suit gloves one at a time and held them steady for the guys. Hopper wound the copper wire around each cuticle tip of the glove and Mel would apply a drop of epoxy to glue the wire to the glove. The gloves, like the rest of the suit don't conduct any electricity and that's a feature. This time, however, we needed Hopper to be able to conduct some electricity an the tips of his gloves. He would have to be able to close some fine electrical circuitry with his heavily gloved paws.

I think the exercise worked well for everybun. Maybe we still didn't know what we were doing, but at least we broke it down int small hops. Thus, we had to get Hopper and Mel suited up and go into the Behemoth to dispatch the small pods. I was helping Hopper get his suit on when I  noticed he had difficulties getting his right leg into the suit. His foot kept shaking and so did his paws. I grabbed the suit  and his foot and helped him slowly quid it in. His eyes were large, almost popping out. His jaw was clenched and his nose kept twitching nervously. 
"OK, Hopper, the other foot now, " I said gently, looking him in the eye. He nodded and we worked that other foot into the suit. His nose calmed down a little and we worked on the suit-up. Once he got the bottom on, we got the top on without a problem. As soon as I could,  I got him to help Mel get ready. I turned up the temperature in the craft. It got cold at night. the chill helped us sleep, but now was exasperating Hopper's anxiety. 

At the last minute, I changed my mind about staying behind while they go in and decided to join them. Hopper was especially glad and perked up a bit. It took us longer to get out, but I was glad to witness our first interactive engagement with the Behemoth.

We've made an easy work of getting to the control center of the Behemoth. 

- HOPPER WORKS THE BEHEMOTH -
The three formations of pebbles resembling celestial structures were still in the command center of the Behemoth. they seemed undisturbed since the last time we've seen them and the central one continued to glow faintly.

We followed Hopper as he moved closer in toward the surface of the chamber. He looked for a while to locate the contact points on the wall and finally pointed to them. He placed hi gloves over the dimples and spread his gloved cuticles as far apart as he could to reach the proper indentations. Those dimples in the surface of the chamber were the spots where the "passengers" of the 
behemoth would make physical contact with the ship to interact with it. They did conduct tiny amounts of electricity. Hopper had to have something conductive on his gloves to do the same.

In two different spots, on his left and right, at about his eye level, two polyp-like protuberances emerged from the surface, almost as if growing out of it in blink of an eye. We gave Hopper a little push with our thrusters toward the wall as he tried to grab the knuckle and pull on it. The knuckle blob stretched like a semi dry resin, forming a thin string of that stuff, like a strand of silk. It remained attached to the wall of the chamber.  

He turned to the one on the left, grabbed it with both paws and pulled it apart. The glob expanded easily, forming a circular rim around a central piece. The rim remained connected to the center by what looked like a super thing filaments, like the one connecting the center piece to the wall. The outer edge of the formation was hallow and its shape was held by some type of thread of fiber, this time forming a octal helix pattern. Hopper pinched the middle glob and pulled out a small fragment of it, stretching it until he reached the outer rim of the shape. The rim seamed to absorb the bead of the substance and blended with it. the strand connecting it to the center piece gently waved back and forth.
I remembered to glance at Hopper's biometrics. His hear rate was uncomfortably high. 
"Hopper, do you need a break? You're doing great!" I tried to draw him out. Hopper didn't flinch, only slowly nodded his head and and down, keeping his eyes on the task at paw. 

He repeated a similar routine with the glob on his right. This time he made the form a lot smaller. He pinched a bead of the substance from the centerpiece and pulled it over all the way to the centerpiece on his left. He repeated that for every pod the behemoth had left. When he got done, the two formations were connected by the thin, stretched threads of substance from the right formation.

Next, Hopper reduced the circumference of each outer rim by gently grabbing it and pulling his paws together. The rim got smaller and smaller, finally collapring and disappearing into the center piece. He did the same to the shape on his right. Finally, he brough the two centerpieces together and collaped them into one. 

Once again, we gave Hopper a gentle push toward the wall as he pressed the two connected shapes looking like a handle into the wall of the Behemoth. The "handle" disappeared into the wall completely. We kept the pressure on Hopper a little longer. He again pressed his gloves into the dimples on the wall, changing the configuration of his touch. After a couple of seconds, he said, "OK, it's done! The pods should be gone now, or at least be on their way!" He later told us that he felt the wall vibrate once the Behemoth accepted the program. The vibration was too gentle for Mel and myself to notice. Hopper's suit must have absorbed the or maybe we were too tense to perceive them.

Hopper looked at me with the same hopeful look he had that morning. I looked at him and motioned us to get back. I didn't want to show it, but I could wait to get tot he astro-bubble and see for myself that the pods  were gone from the Behemoth. We've come back tour craft fast and got out of our suits in a record time. 

Without saying a word, Mel darted to the bubble, while Hopper and I jumped to the controls on the flight deck. We backed out our craft away and aft of the Behemoth's rear end.
"Yep, the pods  are gone!" shouted Mel on the loop. 

Hopper's mouf relaxed a bit and his nose was almost still. His breathing relaxed, he closed his eyes and pulled himself tighter into the seat. I put the seat restraints on him and pulled them tight. Hopper didn't move, and sat there, his paws tucked under the belts. I felt his ears and they were getting icy. I asked Mel to make warm recovery mix smoothie and he brought it over. Hopper must have been hungry like a Flemish Giant, because he drained the sippy bag in a flash. he grunted with relief and satisfaction. His ears relaxed. I was hoping this was only anxiety. I sure hoped we wouldn't have to get out the old stasis-snake. However, I was glad the Mel had it inspected and couple o days ago.
I let him be and pushed pushed myself off toward the astro-bubble.

Mel was looking out at the Behemoth, half excited, half perplexed. Just like the time when you pull thee perfect carrot out of the ground and your are fascinated that the carrot grew. The knot in my gut was gone.
"Hopper, the pods are gone, they are really gone." I said, hopping that Hopper would come around soon. 

Mel and I stared at the Behemoth for a little longer. I still had a hard time believing that very soon we would be taking our biggest chance yet, trying to get home in that thing.

When we finally came out of our stupor, Mel helped me get the life support unit  and flight data recorder module into the airlock. We recharged our suits and we checked one time the calculations for our ship's autopilot.

I checked on Hopper. I've been so busy and he's been so quiet, I almost forgot about him. when I checked on him, he was still in his seat just the way I left him. His straps were loosened up a lot, and his paws were still tucked behind them. Hopper fell asleep. His mouf was little opened and his eyes were busy behind his eyelids. Our excursion really did a job on him. I grabbed Hopper's blankie from the his sleeping burrow-bag and tucked it around him. Hid didn't even flinch. I could only hope he would stay like that through the night. If he could get some decent rest, we would all be better for it. 

Before calling it a day, Mel and I pulled up our "evacuation checklist" on the screen and we went over it one more time. We had almost everything checked off. we tried to see if we missed anything or forgot about something that we needed to add to the list, but we came up with nothing. 

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed Hopper floating toward his burrow-bag. he waved at us without opening his eyes. It has gotten late indeed. Hopefully, our last nigh on orbit wouldn't be our last night.
