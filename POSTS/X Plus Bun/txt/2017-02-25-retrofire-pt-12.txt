X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 12

First thing in the morning, we worked on making a checklist for the evacuation. I didn't mention that we had no printer to print the checklist.  It was the rehersal I wanted us to go through. We we got done, Hopper looked at me with a frown when his "no-printer" light went on. 

- MAKING OF HOPPER'S GLOVES - 

I think the exercise worked well for everybun. Maybe we still didn't know what we were doing, but at least we broke it down int small hops. Thus, we had to get Hopper and Mel suited up and go into the Behemoth to dispatch the small pods. I was helping Hopper get his suit on when I  noticed he had difficulties getting his right leg into the suit. His foot kept shaking and so did his paws. I grabbed the suit  and his foot and helped him slowly quid it in. His eyes were large, almost popping out. His jaw was clenched and his nose kept twitching nervously. 
"OK, Hopper, the other foot now, " I said gently, looking him in the eye. He nodded and we worked that other foot into the suit. His nose calmed down a little and we worked on the suit-up. Once he got the bottom on, we got the top on without a problem. As soon as I could,  I got him to help Mel get ready. I turned up the temperature in the craft. It got cold at night. the chill helped us sleep, but now was exasperating Hopper's anxiety. 

At the last minute, I changed my mind about staying behind while they go in and decided to join them. Hopper was especially glad and perked up a bit. It took us longer to get out, but I was glad to witness our first interactive engagement with the Behemoth.

We've made an easy work of getting to the control center of the Behemoth. 

- HOPPER WORKS THE BEHEMOTH -
- TEMP: Hopper pulled up the model of the ship and entered the commands to dispatch the pods. When collapsed the model with his gloved paws is if clasping them in fron of him, the command was executed. he looked at me with the same hopeful look he had that morning. I looked at him and motiend us to et back. I didn't want to show it, but I could wait to get tot he astro-bubble and see for myself that the pods  were gone from the Behemoth. We've come back tour craft fast and got out of our suits in a record time.
