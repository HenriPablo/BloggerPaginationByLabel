X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 3

While Zoomer stayed glued to the window, I updated my notes. We had two major items left to do: find and capture the booster we just send off and perform the deorbit burn. When it's all said and done. We tried to do through each flight, go home for dinner. Such thing it's a lousy dinner after a flight. It sounds trite I know of but I don't know of any bun going to space to boil themselves Frozen in the airlock. We just love to make Journey, that's the best dressing for any dinner salad potter house in pool fancy. If Zoomer keeps it up for a couple more days, she will have no problems. She is passing with flying colors.

I updated my notes and joined her by the window. She was just gazing outside. Like we all like to do. "It's true; the stars don't sparkle, do they? asked Zoomer. "If you like this, just wait until you get to go outside," I added after a long pause and stayed by the window for a while longer until we entered the next night cycle. It was getting late the day had been a long one. I grabbed a couple of soft biscuits from the pantry locker and warmed up some chamomile tea, fortified with vitamins and minerals. I asked Zoomer if she wanted a sleeping agent and she said yes. I mixed that with her tea. I decided to not take anything, and that would leave me sleeping like, well, a rabbit.


We spent the rest of the evening having a dinner snack by the window. Before we retired for the night, we turned down the temperature in a capsule, got out some thermal blankets and stuffed them into the sleeping pockets. That is as close as a bun can get here to sleeping under a cozy duvet. I like being on the couch that is in a flight deck position. Should something happen or if the center needs to get a hold of us, we are right by the controls. Zoomer was out in no time, but it took me a while to drift off into slumber. I missed Abby already, and I wondered how she was doing on her hydroponic trip.

The next day I got up early. I didn't get much sleep during the night and the sleep I got felt lousy. Center had a stock mike. I could hear the calls reminding him of it, and he would fix it, but then it would get stuck again. Luckily, we had a pretty light day today. I warmed up the capsule and woke up Zoomer. She opened her eyes and for a second, had a look of panic on her mouth. Then it all seemed to drift back into place. It would be nice if things could fall into place here, that would be so much faster, but in microgravity, you get what you can. I got the breakfast going, and Zoomer performed the usual morning checks, attitude, orbit, system checks, and logs. As we nomed the soft biscuits and sipped the raspberry compote, we went over the science experiment Zoomer had to deploy. She would do that during the call with the class of bunletts that designed the experiment. I think it had something to do with synthetic microorganisms and the effects of radiation and their decision-making, or something like that. Or maybe I'm confusing flight, I don't remember exactly. Zoomer set up the video call with the bunletts, and they would guide Zoomer through the entire exercise. The crowd on the ground looked formidable. At first, the little ones were very shy, but they relaxed once we turned to the deployment of the experiment. The introductions and pleasantries were uncomfortable and awkward for everyone. In the background, I saw some older buns that did not look happy. Maybe this was too boring, or they thought this whole affair was way beneath them. They just seemed like a bunch of disdainful inquisitors. Once the bunletts started on their checklist, they forgot about the whole world. They fought over the instructions, argued with bun another, and created a male that seemed bigger than all of them put together. Zoomer let them get on like that for a while until she had had enough of it and called them to attention. I floated in the background and tried to put on a serious face. One day Zoomer would be doing the same thing I am, and somebun from that warren on the ground would be here, trying to command a swarming cloud of thumping fuzzies. 

Once they settled a bit, the class leader explained the purpose of the experiment and started reading off the checklist. Her friend watched everything she did, ready to pounce on any mistakes. Thus, Zoomer unpacked the experiment from one of the storage lockers and proceeded with the rest of the checklist. Now, the little ones were starting to climb over bunanother to get close to the screen, trying to will themselves into the capsule, with their little mouf gaping and eyes popping out. Zoomer took the first part of the experiment and secured it to the capsule with a restraint strap while I got the exchange lock ready for the second part. Once we got the second part exposed to the outside environment, the bunletts activated the experiment with a radio signal. The tiny indicator lights on the containers lit up, and the telemetry from the experiment started arriving on the ground. They went wild again. Zoomer was smitten by the nervous energy and excitement of the bunletts, and neither of us wanted to move on from this exercise. Zoomer promised everybun to check in with the class after the flight, but that did little to cheer up their fuzzy faces. 

The time came for Zoomer to do some proper flying and recapture the booster. It sat in a slightly higher orbit, so Zoomer had to catch up with it. She did all the preparation for the burn I did whatever she asked me to do. She delegated well and kept me busy. I had all the support stuff, like talking to the center, verifying parameters, double-checking her calculations and things like that. The few hours it took us to change orbit dragged on forever for me. Zoomer thought they flew by like minutes. She did seem a little anxious, but it was her first rendezvous. Her calculations proved to be spot-on, and she was ecstatic when the booster came into view right where she expected it to appear.
