X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 3

While Zoomer stayed glued to the window, I updated my notes. We had two major items left to do: find and capture the booster we just send off and perform the deorbit burn. When it's all said and done. We tried to do through each flight, go home for dinner. Such thing it's a lousy dinner after a flight. It sounds trite I know of but I don't know of any bun going to space to boil themselves Frozen in the airlock. We just love to make Journey, that's the best dressing for any dinner salad potter house in pool fancy. If Zoomer keeps it up for a couple more days, she will have no problems. She is passing with flying colors.

My notes and joined her by the window. She was just gazing outside. Like we all like to do. It's true they don't Sparkle do they set Zoomer.,. Just wait if you like this just wait until you get to go outside, I added after a long pause. I stayed by the window for a while longer, until we entered the next night cycle. It was getting late they have been a long one. I grabbed a couple of soft biscuits pantry Locker in the warmed up some camomile tea. Fortified with vitamins and minerals. I asked Zoomer if she wanted sleeping agent and she said yes. I mixed that with her t. That would leave me sleeping like,,. A rabbit


Dinner snack by the window was how the rest of the evening went. We turned down the temperature in a capsule, got out some thermal blankets and stuff them into the sleeping pockets. That is as close as a bond can get here to sleeping under a cozy blanket. And I like being on the couch that is in a flight deck position. Should something happen or if the center needs to get a hold of us, we are right by the controls. Zoomer was out in no time. It took me a while to drift off into slumber. I missed Abby already in wondered how she was doing on her hydroponic trip.
