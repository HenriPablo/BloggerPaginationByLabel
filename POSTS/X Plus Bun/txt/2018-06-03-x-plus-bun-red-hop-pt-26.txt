X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 26

Author's note:

Abby listened to all the communications between our capsule and the Center, starting from our countdown to liftoff. She paid very close attention ever since we could not separate from the booster after our docking exercise. She and the crew were at the Mybanana Islands on a special assignment at the hydroponic labs. She was helping at a summer camp where bunletts could get extra credits in earth sciences. To her and the crew it was a vacation even though it kept everybunny busy. Somehow, she managed to keep track of our developments and watch how the little ones tended to the sea carrots. They hated the warm, salty water, they hated water - period, but they needed to learn how to handle it. It came with the territory of becoming a bunstronaut. Pancake watched over them when Abby couldn't. Joey always preferred to be as far away from the water as he could. He preferred the kitchen and fire. It was easier to keep his stogies lit that way. He always did his best to keep the ashes out of the pots and pans though. Molly, Penny, and Ava also helped to chaperone the bunletts. It was a strange vacation where every bun’s paws were so full. They loved the bunletts  and it was a welcomed change of pace. The bunletts were eager to soak up everything they could from the seasoned bunstronauts. Old stories filled the evenings and not a drop of memories went into the sand.

Maybe it was a pure coincidence or a premonition, or a finely tuned instinct that made Abby pause, when Penelope, a shy and most water averse bunlett, yet again refused to suit up and work in the sea bog. Abby asked her to go to Penny and Molly and configure the catamaran for sea rescue. Penelope helped them load extra fuel cells and supplies. She checked and updated the navigation and guidance systems. Abby wanted everybun to be able to make flight status at some point, but she wasn't sure if this was for Penelope. She didn’t see how Penelope could compensate for such a strong aversion to anything related to water.

Everybunny on the ground perked up some more once Zoomer announced that we needed help from the cutter probe. One night, she and Pancake discussed what would happen if Zoomer and I landed in a close neighborhood of their island. They considered our orbital path and concluded, that at least in theory, we could make a splashdown nearby. Everybunny forgot about us the next day and went back to watching the bunletts watching the different samplings of the sea carrots. 

Abby happened to listen in on us when the cutter probe arrived. She heard me throw the emergencies at Zoomer. It didn’t take long for Pancake to realize we would be coming down in a hurry.

The bunletts were just cleaning themselves and getting dry after the day’s work when Abby run up to them, holding two life jackets and started, “I need two volunteers to go on a live rescue. That’s a live ...” but she didn’t finish. Penelope lunged at her and grabbed one of the life jackets. Abby tried again, “OK, I need one more vol...” This time she got tackled by rest of the little warren that twisted itself into a knot around the second life preserver. Pancake untangled them from Abby and found the little Gus clutching the vest with all four paws, his eyes were shut, and his little jaw was clenched.

“Well, then, follow Pancake and Molly, we’ll be leaving in a minute!” announced Abby. She was stunned by what Penelope did. That was the one thing Abby would have never predicted.

Joey watched the little maelstrom with his mouf hanging open and almost lost his stogie. He looked like the prototypical tourist, in his flower shirt, tattered cargo shorts, flip-flops and a spatula in his paw. He turned around and called Ava and Penny. They worked on getting Abby the exact location of our landing. Pancake brought out the catamaran from its shelter and helped everybun to board the ship in record time. Once they left the dock, she handed the wheel to Penelope, “Here, keep her on a heading of One Six Zero for now.” She tethered the now delirious bunlett to a paw rail. Penelope jumped and thumped for a while before she settled down to steer the ship. In the background, they heard little Gus talking to Joey and getting the exact numbers ready for the rendezvous with our Red Hop capsule.
