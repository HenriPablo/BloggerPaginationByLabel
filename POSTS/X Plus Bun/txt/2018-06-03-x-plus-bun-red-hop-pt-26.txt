X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 26

Author's note:

Abby listened to all the communications between our capsule and the Center , starting with our lift off countdown. She paid very close attention since we run into issues separating from the booster after our docking exercise. Somehow, she manage to keep track of our developments as she watched what the bunletts were doing on the hydroponic farm. The little ones worked on getting extra credit in the Earth Sciences by tending to the saltwater sea carrots. They hated the warm, salty water, they hated water period, but needed to learn how to handle it. It came with the territory of becoming a bunstronaut. Pancake watched over them when Abby couldn't. Joey always preferred to be as far away from the water as he could. He preferred the kitchen and fire. It complimented his stogie habit. He always did his best to keep the ashes out of the the pots and pans. Molly Penny and Ava helped with the rest and shapraoned the bunletss. It was a strange vacation with everybun's paws being so full. But it was a great change of pace. There loved the buneltts. The bunelss were eager to soak up everything they could from the seasoned bunstronauts. Evenings were filled with old stories and the young ones soaked it all up, not a drop of memories went into the sand. Balmy seabreeze and sunsets in the Mybanana Islands made it magical. 

Maybe it was a pure coincidence, or a premonition or finely tuned instinct that made Abby pause. When Penelope, a shy and most water averse bunlett yet again refused to suit up and work in the sea bog, Abby asked her to inspect their catamaran. She had her go and and ask Penny and Molly to configure the ship for a sea rescue. Penelope helped them load extra fuel cells and supplies. She checked and updated the navigation and guidance systems. Abby worried about Penelope because she was at times very timid and shy on top of hating water like no bun else. Abby wanted everybun to be able to make flight status at some point, but she wasn't sure if this was for Penelope.
