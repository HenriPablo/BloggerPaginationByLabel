X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 26

Author's note:

Abby listened to all the communications between our capsule and the Center, starting with our liftoff countdown. She paid very close attention since we run into issues separating from the booster after our docking exercise. Somehow, she managed to keep track of our developments as she watched what the bunletts were doing on the hydroponic farm. The little ones worked on getting extra credit in the Earth Sciences by tending to the saltwater sea carrots. They hated the warm, salty water, they hated water, period, but needed to learn how to handle it. It came with the territory of becoming a bunstronaut. Pancake watched over them when Abby couldn't. Joey always preferred to be as far away from the water as he could. He preferred the kitchen and fire. It complimented his stogie habit. He always did his best to keep the ashes out of the pots and pans. Molly Penny and Ava helped with the rest and chaperoned the bunletts. It was a strange vacation where every bun’s paws being so full. But it was a welcomed change of pace. There loved the bunletts. The bunletts were eager to soak up everything they could from the seasoned bunstronauts. Old stories filled the evenings, and the young ones soaked it all up, not a drop of memories went into the sand. Balmy sea breeze and sunsets in the Mybanana Islands made it magical.

Maybe it was a pure coincidence, or a premonition or finely tuned instinct that made Abby pause. When Penelope, a shy and most water averse bunlett yet again refused to suit up and work in the sea bog, Abby asked her to inspect their catamaran. She had her go and ask Penny and Molly to configure the ship for sea rescue. Penelope helped them load extra fuel cells and supplies. She checked and updated the navigation and guidance systems. Abby worried because Penelope was at times very timid and shy on top of hating water like no bun else. Abby wanted everybun to be able to make flight status at some point, but she wasn't sure if this was for Penelope.

Everybunny on the ground perked up once Zoomer announced that we needed help from the cutter probe. One night, she and Pancake discussed what would happen if Zoomer and I landed in a close neighborhood of their island. They considered our orbital path and concluded, that at least in theory, we could make a splashdown nearby.

They forgot about us the next day and went back to tracking the bunletts and the growth progress of the different samplings of the sea carrots. Abby happened to listen in on us when the cutter probe arrived. She heard me throw the emergencies at Zoomer. It didn’t take long for Abby to realize we would be coming down in a hurry.

The bunletts were just cleaning themselves and getting dry after the day’s work when Abby run up to them, holding two life jackets. “I need two volunteers to go on a live rescue. That’s a live ...” she didn’t finish when Penelope lunged at her and grabbed one of the life jackets. “OK, I need one more vol...” she got tackled by rest of the little warren that now twisted itself into a know around that life preserver. Abby untangled them and found the little Gus clutching the vest with all four paws.

“Well then, follow pancake and molly, we’ll be leaving in a minute!” announced Abby. She was stunned by what Penelope did. That was the one thing Abby would have never predicted.

Joey watched the little maelstrom with mouf hanging open and almost lost his stogie. He looked like the prototypical tourist, in his flower shirt, tattered shorts, flip-flops and a spatula in his paw. He turned around and called Ava and Penny. They would work on getting Abby the exact location of our landing. Pancake brought out the catamaran from its shelter and helped everybun to board the ship in record time. Once they left the dock, she handed the wheel to Penelope, “Here, keep her on a heading of one six zero for now.” She tethered the now delirious bunlett to a paw rail. Little Penelope jumped and thumbed for a while before she settled down to steering the ship. Abby and Pancake didn’t know what to make of it. In the background, they heard little Gus talking to Joey and getting the exact number ready for the rendezvous with the Red Hop capsule.
