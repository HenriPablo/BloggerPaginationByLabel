X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 22

Author’s note: Last week, Mr. Toes and his fellow bunstronauts said their goodbyes to Hopmeric, the indigenous hare they befriended. With heavy hearts, they started on the final preparations for liftoff in an attempt to get back “home.”

I woke up to the vibrations of the ships ventilation system running high gear. The place smelled again like a space-faring vessel and gone were the scent of the wilderness outside. I think the sterile, familiar smells helped me get into my work routine very quickly. I welcomed the relief of slipping back into the old habits that suppressed the emotional roller coaster of the last couple of days. There would be a time and place to deal with it later. When Joey woke up, I send him to help with the never-ending cleanup in the engine room. I wanted him to swing the broom, to do anything that would get him physically active. Then it hit why the ventilation system was so loud. Abby was still trying to get rid of the particulate contamination. Joey could help them kick up into the air as much of particulate as possible and, hopefully, most of it would end up in the filter.

After reviewing everything I've done since the day before and preparing my part of the pre-liftoff briefing, I went where else, but to the engine room. I took the magneto-wiper from Abby and did some of the cleanups myself. She took Pancake, and Ava and hopped off to the flight deck to give the chrono-chromium injector one last test. The rest of us finished the cleanup, and at last, we got the green light on the contamination detector. The engine room was clean enough. Well, at least the sensors were happy and to be honest, we were reaching a "don't care" level of burnout. Joey looked lively again, he gripped his broom proudly, and hade a stern, sardonic almost, frown on his mouf. "Is this our equivalent of having clean underwear?" Joey mused with a glare. 

All I could do was to pat Joey on his shoulder as I headed to the flight deck. The launch briefing was extensive. I went through the different stages of liftoff, and we verified all the flight parameters. We checked all the data I had entered into the control systems. There was one thing we added to the checklist and executed that item right then and there.  Peny though it would be prudent to turn on the emergency comm system before we even took off. Should we be lucky enough to make a successful return to when we came from, but if we were incapacitated for some reason, the ship would be broadcasting an emergency distress signal on our behalf. 

The clock said we still had a good deal of time left before we had to suit up, so Abby and I went to our pod for one last snurgle. We put on our oxygen masks to pre-breathe pure oxygen. It wasn't the most romantic date, but we made due, and a cozy nap was a cozy nap.

Late, we suited up and made the very awkward hop to our seats. It was nighttime again,  and in the first row stood now, but Joey, telescoping and gazing outside. I instinctively looked at the consoles expecting to see a critter or a biped alert. I realized that Joey was looking out because there was no alert, not the one he was still hoping for.
