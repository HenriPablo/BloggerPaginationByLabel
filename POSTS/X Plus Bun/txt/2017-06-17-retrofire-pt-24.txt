X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 24

Freddie stared blankly for a second at the three faces peeking in through the door window. All three wore head cameras, one of them was talking about something without stopping. Then it clicked. Freddie went for the door, tears pooling over his eyes. He found the door release handle by touch. The salty puddles over his eyes grew too big to be held in place by the surface tension and started breaking away. When the door opened, he pulled himself forward and crushed into Pancake. He tried to wrap his tiny paws around her neck. Penny nosebonked Molly. The third bun was named Rhea, she was one of the news buns, and she kept narrating the encounter for its continued live broadcast.

Pancake put her paw around Freddie and squeezed him tight as she quickly floated into the room. She released Mel from his seat and pulled his body into the open. He was out called and unresponsive. She pulled out the tranquilizer dart out of his neck and looked at the label on the ampule. Well, Mel, still had a few good hours of stone-cold slumber ahead of him, but that was all. The same turned out to be the case for Toes and Hopper.

Penny grabbed Mel his collar, Pancake and Molly took hold of Hopper and me respectively. They got out of the room with us in toe as quickly as they could and headed for the safety of the news ship. They barely made it into the airlock when the ship separated fro the hospital and started turning around. All the while Rhea continued to call evacuation on a live broadcast with play by play commentary.

She had so many questions, but at the moment only Penny could speak. Freddie must have turned into a marsupial as he refused to let go of Pancake and kept his head buried in fur under Pancake's chin.

To every bum's surprise, sensors on the ship picked up a personal distress signal. The signal came from somewhere nearby. It turned out it was so close they had a hard time believing it. Somebun was free-floating in space on the other side of the hospital module they left behind.

"Whoever is the closest to being suited up, get the Roach ready!" the ship's commander sounded over the intercom and swore like a space sailor. A couple of the news buns scrambled and gathered around Penny and Pancake, with Freddie still holding onto her for dear life. Unflappable Rhea continued to roll with the changing situation, and her calm commentary carried on.

"You too, could you get your helmets on?" asked a news bun. "We will help you get the Roach ready,  you will have to retrieve the survivor." another one said. They meant Penny and Freddie, and they didn't care much for his panic attack. Penny got on with completing her suit up. Pancake started to whisper to Freddie, "Look, take how you feel right now, squeeze it into a little ball and put it my pocket. I'll keep it safe for you, and you ca have it back when you're done with this chore." She accentuated "you're done with this chore" just so ever slightly. After a second she felt Freddie take a deep breath as he picked up his head, looked at her slapped her on the arm, right on one of her pockets.

Freddie pushed off and looked around for his helmet. Molly snacks up behind him and put it over his head.

In the bay before the airlock, news buns were loading propellant cartridges into a long, pill shaped object. It had small thruster at both ends, and the buns were attaching handlebars to it. Those also served as antennas. Now the ship was changing its course trying to get close to the sorry sod floating somewhere in the darkest of darkness. The telemetry from the survivor didn't reveal anything about the survivor; the buns didn't care anyway. Only Freddie worried it could have been a setup. He followed Penny into the airlock all the same. Once inside, they hooked up the tether cable to the Roach. The line also as control wire for the probe. The new buns helped to mount the Roach on a rail for launch and got out of the airlock.

Penny depressurized the airlock and opened the big door. Again being so close to the open space, sparks tingled through her paws. She and Freddie stood clear of the Road and pulled the red handle to softly launched it out into space. When it cleared the ship, the Roach started to home in on the survivor.

All the while the news ship kept moving along toward the creature in distress, but everybun had hoped the probe would snag the drifter first and bring it aboard. Maneuvering a craft the size of the news ship is a tedious and challenging affair on a good night. Everybun on the flight deck watched with apprehension as the probe closed in on the stranded one. When it arrived within reach of its grabber arm of the survivor, it released a spindly appendage with a bunch of fingers that could grab onto anything, like the toes of a gecko.

The probe gripped the survivor on its first attempt, and the flight deck of the news ship erupted in cheer. Penny started to retract the probe's tether line. They were lucky the commander was able to bring the craft almost to stand still until the retrieval was finished. Penny watched as the probe got closer and closer to the airlock. She kept her paw on a joystick to adjust the craft's orientation if it looked like the survivor would get shipped around and smashed against the hull of the ship. But the line kept coming in slow and steady. Toward the end, she had to make two adjustments. The thrusters thumped the ship like hammers, and she felt the violent shudder of the vessel's body. Whoever they were fishing out of the deep space was almost inside. As all the tether line got retracted, it brought the probe to a hold inside the airlock. Freddie immediately threw the handle to close the airlock.

Penny took a look at the freshly rescued stranger and yelled out, "We need a medic!" the time it took the airlock to pressurize always feels long, but this time it left like an eternity. Penny looked at Freddie with dread in her eyes and said, "This is Dr. Hopnom!"
