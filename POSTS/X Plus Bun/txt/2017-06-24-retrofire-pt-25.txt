X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 25

When the airlock finally opened, couple of the news buns started to work on Dr. Hopnom. As  soon as they took off his helmet, somebun secured a portable respirator mask over his mouf. they pulled him out of his suit and moved him to the medical station. Freddie started to inspect the Doctor's suit. The CO2 scrubber warming light was still blinking. Freddie found the reset switch for the unit and cycled it. The warning light turned off. He shrugged and said, "Nothing wrong with the suit. It's old and and seen brighter start, but it's basically OK. They guy just didn't initialize it properly."
"Maybe he grabbed it in a hurry, it doesn't look like he knew what he was doing. I told you he seemed very lost when I last saw him in that ship." said Penny.

Freddie and Penny got out of their suits and stowed them away. They grabbed Hopnom's suit and floated toward the med station. That' where everybun seemed to congregating. Mel, Hopper and I had oxygen masks on and we were breathing in an antidote for the tranquilizer. Abby told me Mel and Hopper came to first, but I had to take my sweet time. She laughed  nervously and said that maybe I enjoyed it. Dr. Hopnom wasn't well at all. They got him breathing on his own again, but no more than that. 

I finally got to see Abby. they told me she didn't leave my side since I arrived on the ship. she found me a fresh, blue suit to put on and I ditched the nasty hospital scrubs we used as a "disguise." A lot of good that did us. Rhea finally got to interview Hopper and Mel. My guys looked as gallant in their fresh garbs as if they were the first bunstronauts that walked on the moon or something. Good for them, they've earned it. I would have my turn at the mike later. Like a rookie, I was still groggy and nauseous. Abby helped me to her small cabin and wrapped me in a blanket. Her cabin smelled of mint and basil. She fixed a pouch of freshly crushed herbs to one of the air vents and it made the cabin feel very refreshing. We didn't talk much. She was just glad that I made it out in one piece from this near disaster. She held me tight. I thought we'll have plenty of time to talk later.

At the moment the news ship was heading back to the repair hub. Abby said the news buns wanted as much of our stories as possible to be in the open before they would dock with anything. They were able to send the broadcast feed masquerading as a maintenance data to a couple of compromised weather and relay satellites. Those in turn would send the information out as telemetry. Finally, the news buns' cohorts and partners in resilience would decode and distribute it as normal data. When the news of our return broke, it reached a level of critical mass fast enough that it couldn't be effectively countered or put back in the bottle. The powers to be had to roll with it whether they like it or not.

While Mel and Hopper kept recounting what happened on the Behemoth, Freddie got down to a more detailed diagnostic work on Hopnom's suit. He connected the suit to terminal and tried to figure out why the air purifier went off-line. Of course, the bigger question remained as to why Dr. Hopnom ended up floating in space. Was it his idea to literally jump ship or did somebun helped him?
