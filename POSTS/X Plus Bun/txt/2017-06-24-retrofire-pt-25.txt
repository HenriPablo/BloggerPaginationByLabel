X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 25

When the airlock finally opened, a couple of the news buns started to work on Dr. Hopnom. As soon as they took off his helmet, somebun secured a portable respirator mask over his mouf. They pulled him out of his suit and moved him to the medical station. Freddie started to inspect the Doctor's suit. The CO2 scrubber warning light was still blinking. Freddie found the reset switch for the unit and cycled it. The warning light turned off. He shrugged and said, "Nothing wrong with the suit. It's old and seen brighter start, but it's basically OK. They guy just didn't initialize it properly."
"Maybe he grabbed it in a hurry; it doesn't look like he knew what he was doing. I told you he seemed very lost when I last saw him on that ship," said Penny.

Freddie and Penny got out of their suits and stowed them away. They grabbed Hopnom's suit and floated toward the med station. That' where everybun seemed to congregate. Mel, Hopper and I had oxygen masks on, and we were breathing in an antidote for the tranquilizer. Abby told me Mel and Hopper came to first, but I had to take my sweet time. She laughed nervously and said that maybe I enjoyed it. Dr. Hopnom wasn't well at all. They got him breathing on his own again, but no more than that. 

I finally got to see Abby. They told me she didn't leave my side since I arrived on the ship. she found me a fresh, blue suit to put on and I ditched the nasty hospital scrubs we used as a "disguise." A lot of good that did us. Rhea finally got to interview Hopper and Mel. My guys looked as gallant in their new garbs as if they were the first bunstronauts that walked on the moon or something. Good for them, they've earned it. I would have my turn at the mike later. Like a rookie, I was still groggy and nauseous. Abby helped me to her small cabin and wrapped me in a blanket. Her cabin smelled of mint and basil. She fixed a pouch of freshly crushed herbs to one of the air vents, and it made the cabin feel very refreshing. We didn't talk much. She was just glad that I made it out in one piece from this near disaster. She held me tight. I thought we'll have plenty of time to talk later.

At the moment the news ship was heading back to the repair hub. Abby said the news buns wanted as much of our stories as possible to be in the open before they would dock with anything. They were able to send the broadcast feed masquerading as a maintenance data to a couple of compromised weather and relay satellites. Those, in turn, would send the information out as telemetry. Finally, the news buns' cohorts and partners in resilience would decode and distribute it as normal data. When the news of our return broke, it reached a level of critical mass fast enough that it couldn't be effectively countered or put back in the bottle. The powers to be had to roll with it whether they like it or not.

While Mel and Hopper kept recounting what happened on the Behemoth, Freddie got down to a more detailed diagnostic work on Hopnom's suit. He connected the suit to a terminal and tried to figure out why the air purifier went off-line. Of course, the bigger question remained as to why Dr. Hopnom ended up floating in space. Was it his idea to literally jump ship or did somebun helped him? 

Freddie knew the suit wouldn't tell him everything, but it might offer some ideas. He made a virtual backup of the suit's system and started looking at the logs.  One thing that jumped out at him was the fact that no bun did any pressure checks before the last use of the suit. The CO2 scrubber worked fine; just no bun turned it on. Freddie thought it sure looked possible that somebun unqualified attempted to sue that suit. He remembered how Penny got flustered when she discovered Dr. Hopnom pretending to be a crew member while he had no idea how to move about like one.

Then again, if somebun tried to get rid of him and wanted to make it look like an accident, it almost worked. 

As Freddie kept staring the logs, he could see and hear the two news buns attending to Dr. Hopnom a little farther down the tunnel. They had the Doctor connected to a terminal and were transmitting his biometrics to the medical staff at the Repair Hub. Freddie wasn't listening on their loop and heard only the news buns speaking.  He overheated something about nano-regeneration procedure waiting for the Doctor. Freddie nodded and thought to himself, "That would be the only feasible next step if Hopnom were to tell them anything." 

The therapy would involve a solution with a swarm of specialized carbon nanotubes.  Those would circulate through Hopnom brain tissue and attempt to repair and reconstruct his damaged neural networks. Most likely not all connection would be restored, but int the end Hopnom would almost be as good as news. Maybe even worse, some connections would be stronger than they were before the accident. He might ever remember more than he would want to. Would he really care to recall that bully from preschool that used to break his glasses?

Freddie made a quick mental note: "Check who prepared the swarm solution." The swarm could just as easily selectively wipe out everything connected with the Behemoth, Mr. Toes, and near tragic suit incident.
