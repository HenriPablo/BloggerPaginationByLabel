It feels just like yesterday when you and I had watched "The Last Man On The Moon." Now, you and Gene have both gone over the Bridge. Did he mellow out any?

It turns out that time does nothing, or, at least, it does not do much. I thought that maybe, by now, the crater you had left would be absorbed by some Sea of Tranquility but no such luck.

A day hadn't gone by, since last year, in which I didn't miss you.
Binky free, Mr. Bun.
