X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 27

Author's note:
"Red Hop One, Center," said the Capcom. It was good to hear Hopper.
"Go ahead Center," said Zoomer.
"Red Hop One, we have two amphibian transports heading your way, and we have a catamaran on its way to meet you. I think it's the WaveHopper. It will be in your area before the AquaRexes," said the Capcom.
"Red Hop One, this WaveHopper, how do you read?" That was the voice I've been waiting to hear!
"Loud and clear, Abby, I mean WaveHopper!" I jumped on the mike.
"Get ready, Major, we're almost there!" announced Zoomer. I adjusted myself in the couch one last time and made sure my mouf was closed correctly. I double checked to keep my tongue away from my teeth.

"Grumph!" the shock absorbers grunted when we hit the water, and our couches took softened the punch of the landing. Now the up and down motion of our capsule was unnerving as we bobbed up and down in the sea. At least the capsule was oriented correctly, right side up. That's less work and less of a chance to get nauseous. We had made quick work of the After Landing checklist and Zoomer opened the outside air vents. We took off our helmets, and the proper, fresh air felt delightful. Gone was the sterile, machine scented stuff we had been breathing for days. If you're not sure how this is exciting, try going without clean, fresh air for few days. Then go to the beach, or visit your local woods.

"Congratulations, Zoomer! Welcome home, Major!" announced Hopper.
"Rog, thanks for all your help!" I responded.
"WaveHopper is a few minutes away from you; they should be there momentarily. This frequency till the recovery," added Hopper the Capcom. 
"This frequency till the recovery," read back Zoomer. 

I filed my paperwork for Zoomer. It was such a relief to have the formalities over. She was a proper, certificated bunstronaut. We duffed our bulky suits and tried to get used to them falling to the ground. Nothing floated around us anymore. If you tried to let go of your helmet for a second to do something else, it would remind you where you are with a crash. Drink pouches would go splat and sill everything. Sigh... And now the blood started draining from your head. You better sit down.

Soon we hear from Abby again. A little later somebun was banging on our hatch, and I heard strange thumps and scrapes against the outside of our capsule. I could never get used to the otters crawling all over the outside when they worked to secure the capsule.

Before we opened the hatch, Zoomer and I put on our water harnesses and double checked each other. A bun can get very wobbly after a flight like ours and should one end up in the drink, the harness and the life vest that comes with it are bun's best friends. You would have a chance to float and make it easier for the otters to fish you out. We released the hatch when the otters were ready for us. One of them immediate stuck its little head inside the capsule to check on us.

I prompted Zoomer to get out first and immediately pulled her back. 
"Wait, wait. Now you are the proper bunstronaut in command. That makes you the commander, the captain. You're the last one off the ship. I'm sorry, Zoomer. Here, watch me and make sure you hop slowly and deliberately when you're on the catamaran," I said.

An illuminated, rubber slide already connected our capsule and the catamaran. One of the otters tethered me to a cable between the spacecraft and the sea vessel. I checked the tether, just in case. You never know if the otter is having a good night. I slid down toward the ship on my belly; front paws stretched out in front of me. Once at the other end, somebun grabbed me, tethered me to a railing and helped me into a comfy seat. Zoomer followed right behind me. 

We both turned toward the capsule and watched the otters secure it for the night. It had a red and green rotating beacon mounted on the top, where the docking probe is. The otters closed the hatch, released the security line, pulled in the slide and we were ready to go.

We listened to Pancake chat with one of the disappointed AquaRex commanders. There would be no need for them to make a water landing. They would have to settle for an escort flight. Still, the bunletts would get their full credit for the mission, and they would log the flight time. They would like it and brag about it all the same.

A nurse came by to check on us and gave us the diagnostic pellets to swallow. I washed it down with water. Water would have to do for now. For the remainder of the ride home, we tried to relax and enjoy the breeze. Zoomer faced the wind and sat with her eyes closed.  

The ride was quiet, and you could barely heat the engines. Almost all you heard was the catamaran plowing through the ocean. Zoomer did her best to sit up and take in the ambiance, but her head started to drop. She was nodding off. Each time she work up she tried to straighten up more that she did the last time. Finally, she gave up and gave in to  a nap.

Abby sat next to me and we held paws all the way back home. Once the lights of the dock became visible, we woke up Zoomer. The little bunlett at the helm of the shop got some assistance from one of the otters to make sure everyting went smoothly to the very end.

I should have known. The dock looked pretty busy for this time of night. It had to be around midnight local time. There stood Joey and all the bunletts attending the camp. They stood in line, side by side, a shart as a carrot pealer blade. Joey wore his tourister's best for the occasion, even the greasy old chef's hat and was gripping his favorite spatchula. When Zoomer disemarked the ship, Joey blew the whistle, saluted Zoomer and welcomed Zoomer to the camp and drilled the bunletts like an honor guard. We were all take aback and it proved too much for Zoomer. She tried to binky. Zoomer got off the ground alright, but the landing turned out to be tricky. She lost her balance and spilled with a roll. One of the bunletts almost let out a snarl and almost went into the drink. I barely caught the sight of Joey's paw moving away from the offender's scruff.

We marched toward the bonfire and collapsed into the beach chairs. Proper beverages arrived adn we toasted the new, certificated bunstronaut, Zoomer. She retired early to her room. shortly after we heard the windows in her room closing and the air conditioning  coming on. From the sound of it she must have set the temperature in her room every low and Abby and I exchange smiles. Zoomer was just catching on to what she accomplished. she was realizing she was back on the ground and missed the place she just came from. "Was it all real?" she wondered.

ENDING - TAKE 2
