X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 27

Author's note:
"Red Hop One, Center," said the Capcom. It was good to hear Hopper.
"Go ahead Center," said Zoomer.
"Red Hop One, we have two amphibian transports heading your way, and we have a catamaran on its way to meet you. I think it's the WaveHopper. It will be in your area before the AquaRexes," said the Capcom.
"Red Hop One, this WaveHopper, how do you read?" That was the voice I've been waiting to hear!
"Loud and clear, Abby, I mean WaveHopper!" I jumped on the mike.
"Get ready, Major, we're almost there!" announced Zoomer. I adjusted myself in the couch one last time and made sure my mouf was closed correctly. I double checked to keep my tongue away from my teeth.

"Grumph!" the shock absorbers grunted when we hit the water, and our couches took softened the punch of the landing. Now the up and down motion of our capsule was unnerving as we bobbed up and down in the sea. At least the capsule was oriented correctly, right side up. That's less work and less of a chance to get nauseous. We had made quick work of the After Landing checklist and Zoomer opened the outside air vents. We took off our helmets, and the proper, fresh air felt delightful. Gone was the sterile, machine scented stuff we had been breathing for days. If you're not sure how this is exciting, try going without clean, fresh air for few days. Then go to the beach, or visit your local woods.

"Congratulations, Zoomer! Welcome home, Major!" announced Hopper.
"Rog, thanks for all your help!" I responded.
"WaveHopper is a few minutes away from you; they should be there momentarily. This frequency till the recovery," added Hopper the Capcom. 
"This frequency till the recovery," read back Zoomer. 

I filed my paperwork for Zoomer. It was such a relief to have the formalities over. She was a proper, certificated bunstronaut. We duffed our bulky suits and tried to get used to them falling to the ground. Nothing floated around us anymore. If you tried to let go of your helmet for a second to do something else, it would remind you where you are with a crash. Drink pouches would go splat and sill everything. Sigh... And now the blood started draining from your head. You better sit down.

Soon we hear from Abby again. A little later somebun was banging on our hatch, and I heard strange thumps and scrapes against the outside of our capsule. I could never get used to the otters crawling all over the outside when they worked to secure the capsule.
