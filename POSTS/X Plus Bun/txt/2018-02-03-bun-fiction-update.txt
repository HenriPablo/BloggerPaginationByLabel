2018-02-03 Bun Fiction Update

Greetings, Everybunny!

All was going well until Tuesday night we decided to rewrite the opening paragraph of the episode scheduled for today. The rewrite started innocently enough, but six pages of longhand later, we began to suspect we might have a whole new episode on our paws. Well, such are the tangled webs down in the bunny holes. 

Of course, you might be wondering where this whole story is heading? We wonder that ourselves. The story started out as a three, maybe fire part production, and instead we cleaning up episode thirteen and counting.

Remember poor Zoomer? Mr. Toes wanted to tell her a little story, not a saga. Poor Zoomer, she probably fell asleep, and Mr. Toes doesn't even realize it. He'll go on and on like this, and won't get any sleep before the difficult day arrives. 

Well, we will be back on track next week, and we have only a few more episodes to go. In the meaning, let's contemplate some space gown lettuce.
