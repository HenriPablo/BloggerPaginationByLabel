X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 9

"Later that day, we discussed Joey's idea for building a 'dry dock.' The only trouble was, we didn't know what those slabs were made of. If they were granite or basalt, they would support the ship. If that was limestone, or worse yet, sandstone, we had nothing. I wanted to go there before nightfall and chip off a sample. Abby didn't like us going there when it was getting dark, but Joey argued, even though the bipeds were gone, but they might come back soon. If we hurried up, we could be back in no time. Out of  nowhere, pancake showed up with a hammer, 'Here, suit up and go, you won't go anywhere after sunset.' Molly groaned, 'If we land there and incinerate everything, spectroscopy will tell you what kind of stones you got. But you have to burn it slow and good!' Molly drew out her words ominously. Finally, Abby had enough, 'Oh, will you snap out of it already? Get a grip on or we are not going anywhere, got it? Can you maybe try to figure out where we are or run another check on sat nav signal? Could you?'

We all looked at her troubled. I hoped she would come out of that sooner rather than later. We would need all the help we could get. Joey and I hopped on that rusty old scooter and off we went. Abby mounted a couple of extra cameras on the frame of the scooter so her and Pancake could keep extra eyes on our surroundings. Bun only knows what else lives in those surrounding woods. There could be wolves, foxes, badgers perhaps and we had to assume they wouldn't be too friendly. That's when it hit me that we probably wouldn't be going into the forest to sample any wild greens or berries. Good Bun, now we were the fresh morsels!"

I paused the story and turned to Zoomer. "You know, it's hard to do anything when your legs turn into rubber." Zoomer didn't say anything; her nose just kept twitching nervously. But she was still with me, so I carried on.

"I barely got up on the scooter. I strapped in behind Joey and got a death grip on his suit. Joey turned his head back and gave me a confounded look. I snapped, 'You wanted to fly so fly!' 'Rog!' mumbled Joey and accelerated out of the loading bay toward the biped compound. I brought up the map display on my visor. Our ship started to construct a map of the surrounding area so at least we had that much going for us. We knew the distance and heading to the stones.

'You're looking good; all clear between you and the target.' In my helmet Pancake sounded as cool and collected as if she were working another simulator exercise. 'Two minutes to the stones,' added Abby. This time we flew just above the treetops. Tall firs blurred under us. The sky to the west was turning milky dark blue, and the bottoms of the trees were starting to disappear in the ground fog. 

Suddenly, the trees were behind us, and we were over the clearing. Joey made a quick circle over the area; it looked abandoned. We landed on the nearest slab, and before Joey settled down on it, I was out of my seat, hammer, and chisel in paw. 'Hurry up now!' I heard Abby again. The surface of the slab looked clean. I ran my paw against it and felt the rough stone, recently broken off from the strata of its mother. 'Looks like basalt!' I said putting down a patch of adhesive plaster on the surface. I put the edge of the chisel against it and struck it's handle with the hammer as hard as I could. I peeled off the plaster and folded it and hid it in my suit's pocket. I was back on the scooter and said 'Let's check out one or two more. We repeated the routine with two more slabs. They looked like the same material.  I scraped the surface of the rock, and a chill ran down my spine, "This is sandstone!" "Copy that, check another one," came back Pancake. I wobbled over to the scooter and awkwardly climbed in, "Let's go to that one ...," I tapped Joey on his shoulder and pointed to the next slab. We got lucky there; it was basalt. The one after that gave me stomach cramps again: more sandstone. We were calm and collected, stating the finding and going through the dance of back and forth communications, reciting the funeral playbill, pretending it's not ours.

'How are we looking?' I asked. 'Still clear,' came back Pancake. I paused for a moment and opened my visor. The cold, damp air washed over my mouf. It smelled great! The aroma of fresh fir was intoxicating. That's what fresh air is supposed to smell like! I kept still and over the quiet hum of the scooter I could hear an owl in the distance. Something howled, then silence took over again. Some birds started an argument before bedtime. It was getting dark. 

'Major, what are you doing?' Queried Joey, 'We have got to go!' 'I see some torches. Five o'clock and moving toward you, about a mile away!' Abby snapped me out of my dusk dream for good. I was behind Joey in a blink as he gave it all he got. I almost flew out of my seat.
