X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 9

"Later that day, we discussed Joey's idea for building a 'dry dock.' The only trouble was, we didn't know what those slabs were made of. If they were granite or basalt, they would support the ship. If that was limestone, or worse yet, sandstone, we had nothing. I wanted to go there before nightfall and chip off a sample. Abby didn't like us going there when it was getting dark, but Joey argued, the bipeds were probably gone, but they might come back soon. out of  nowhere, pancake showed up with a hammer, 'Here, suit up and go, you won't go anywhere after sunset.' Molly groaned, 'If we land there and incinerate everything, spectroscopy will tell you what kind of stones you got. But you have to bun it slow and good!' Molly drew out the words ominously.

We all looked at her troubled. I hoped she would come out of that sooner rather than later. We would need all the help we could get. Joey and hopped on that rusty old scooter and off we went. Abby mounted a couple of extra cameras on the frame of the scooter so her and Pancake could keep extra eyes on our surroundings. Bun only knows what else lives in those surrounding woods. There could be wolves, foxed, badges perhaps and we had to assume they wouldn't be too friendly. That's when it hit me that we probably wouldn't be going into the forest to sample any wild greens or berries. Good Bun, now we were the fresh morsels!"

"You know, Zoomer, it's hard to do anything when your legs turn into rubber." Zoomer didn't say anything; her nose just kept twitching nervously. But she was still with me, so I carried on.

"I barely got up on the scooter. I strapped in behind Joey and got a death grip on his suit. Joey turned his head back and gave me confounded look. I snapped, 'You wanted to fly so fly!' 'Rog!' quivered Joey and accelerated out of the loading bay toward the biped compound. I brought up the map display on my visor display. Our ship started to construct a map of the surrounding area so at least we had that much going for us. We knew the distance and azimuth to the stones.

'You're looking good; all clear between you and the target.' Pancake sounded in my helmet as cool and collected as if it were another simulator exercise. 'Two minutes to the stones,' added Abby. This time we flew just above the treetops. Tall firs blurred under us. The sky to the west was turning milky dark blue, and the bottoms of the trees were starting to disappear in the ground fog. 

Suddenly, the trees were behind us, and we were over the clearing. Joey made a quick circle over the are, it looked abandoned. Joey landed on the nearest slab, and before he settled down it, I was out of my seat, hammer, and chisel in paw. 'Hurry up now!' I heard Abby again. The surface of the slab looked clean. I ran my paw against it and felt the rough stone, recently broke off from the strata of its mother. 'Looks like basalt!' I said putting down a patch of adhesive plaster on the surface. I put the edge of the chisel against it and struck it's handle with the hammer as hard as I could. I peeled off the plaster and folded it and hid it in my suit's pocket. I was back on the scooter and said 'Let's check out one or two more. We repeated the routine with two more slabs. They looked like the same material. 

'How are we looking?' asked. 'Still clear,' came back Pancake. I paused for a moment and opened my visor. The cold, damp air washed over my mouf. It smelled great! The aroma of fresh fir was intoxicating. That's what fresh air is supposed to smell! I kept still and over the quiet hum of the scooter I could hear an owl in the distance. Then something howled, and silence took over again. Some birds started and argument before bedtime. It was getting dark. 
'Major, what are you doing?' Queried Joey, 'We have got to go!' 'I see some torches. Five o'clock and moving toward you, about a mile away!' Abby snapped me out of my dusk dream for good. I was behind Joey in a blink as he gave it all the got. I almost flew out of my seat.
