I didn't get much sleep that night and woke up after only a few hours. I went to the pantry bay thinking maybe a snack will help. I got hungry at last. On my way, I passed the first-aid station, and there was Mel, messing about with the stasis-snake, a clever little device that relieves gastrointestinal stasis. The rush of adrenaline and hitting the sidewall hard when I grabbed a pawrail to stop woke me up for good. Worried, I asked, "Mel, what do you want with that? What happened?"
"I'm fine. Don't panic, Major, I am making a ton of snacks and stuff. I thought I would get this thing ready, just in case." said Mel.

We got some reconstituted carrots, and nanner chips, a wad of parsley, a few nutriberry cakes and we headed tot he astronavigation bubble. Mel couldn't sleep either; he was just too excited.  I, on the other paw, was filled with dread and thought, "Maybe a little stargazing would calm us down?" Passing by Hopper, we watched him snooze. His eyes were busy under his eyelids and moved about rapidly. His mouf was working too, twitching and smirking, he was gritting his teeth a lot. We moved on.

The view out of the bubble afforded us nothing but the deep space. I placed myself so that no parts of the Behemoth were in my view.  For a while, we enjoyed our makeshift "all-you-can-nom" space buffet. I nomed and nomed until I  properly stuffed myself. I never felt so famished during flight. I had hoped in secret that maybe the next bite would bring me some enlightenment about the decisions we would have to make soon. Of course, no such thing happened. I felt like I ate too much. 

Is this what every commander goes through when they run out pages trying to do things "by-the-book?" 

So, Mel, how come you couldn't sleep? You can't wait to go back, can you?" I broke the silence. Mel looked at me surprised and nodded after a long pause.  I felt a squeeze in my gut and looked away. I stared past the nutriberry crumbs floating by my nose and into the open space trying to locate the Rohan Nebula. I could barely make it out.

"We are going back, aren't we?" asked Mel with trepidation.
"Should we; just because we can now?" I asked in return.

I turned away to look back at the stars. I realized we would be better off discussing the return with Hopper.

What scares me the most now is the explaining of what happened here to our kind back home. Can we waltz back in and tell everybun, "Oh, you see, the ship is so advanced it teaches YOU how to fly it, and IT learns about you!" I think that's what happened yesterday in the Behemoth. First, it taught us what we needed to know about it and then figured out we don't belong here. Did it compare us to some quantum entanglement registry and realized we're in the wrong time-space location?

Of course, back home they will want to know what happened to us. On a molecular level that it. I don't think a post-flight physical will satisfy them. They will want to know what the long-term effects are. I am afraid they will want to keep an eye on us very carefully for a very long time.

The possibility of the ship doing the lesson onto other before they have a chance to refuse it won't do us any good. We are the first ones; we will be the prime specimens, the "patients zero." I am afraid that our return would put our society to the test that I have no control over. I don't know what question they are capable of pursuing and to what extent. Is it going to be all "berries and nanners - we are so glad to see you!" or something like "... Are you back? How fascination, let us have a look at you and don't you dare to come in any closer!"

Now, the little "Aha!" moments seem so insignificant. When we first approached the Behemoth, and it beaconed at us on what looked like every frequency know to bun, from gamma rays to white light, it was trying to transmit on all the frequencies it knew about because it wasn't sure on which one we were listening. It learned about us quickly though and once we were inside it knew that x-ray frequencies would not do it any good; literally. 

I'm not worried about the public's view of us. We'll be heroes for a half a day, and that will be all. The suits, the lab coats, and the uniforms would see to that. It's one thing to debate how far we have come as bunkind, and something else to put it to the test on your own hide. They don't teach "society survival" bunstronaut training. 

On top of that, should I be concerned about how they will use the ship? Maybe they should wait their turn and develop similar technology id their own due time? Then again, what harm could come from a space-time jellyfish like the Behemoth? I immediately felt the sorrow for its passengers. I wasn't sure what happened to them or what relationship they had to the Behemoth. Have they grown out of it or did it grew around them? Maybe our lab coats could figure this one out. 

I felt sorry for they pebbles in the ship because it looked like they were very deliberate in picking their destination and died on their way to it. Would our lab-coats and uniforms accept them as friends or at least as non-foes, even if they were exposed to the same experience in the behemoth as we were? I don't think I can count on that, not a hundred percent, and that's what worries me.

We have entered another sunset on orbit, and once it got dark, the starlight felt even more luminous. I turned around and this time watched how the behemoth reoriented its energy panels. Deep space is where it lived, this as its medium. Mel was looking at the same show, still noming on something. I have lost my appetite again. 

"Let's check our friend, shall we?" asked Mel. I nodded, and we turned around in the bubble. Hopper was out of his burrow. He had his feet in improvised restraints on one of the walls and was doing bun yoga. "Downward Bun"  in zero gravity is not easy and takes a lot of practice, but he nailed it. He had his eyes closed and breathed slowly. A sippy bag of something slowly turned around by his mouf. We tried to stop quietly so not to disturb him. We watched him for a while until he finished. He then rose and stretched out with a huge yawn and smacked his lips. Hopper opened his eyes and smiled at us not surprised. He then rubbed his belly a said, "I'm hungry. Did you guys eat already?"

We had out with Hopper in the pantry bay. He was most appreciative of all the food that Mel prepared. I envied them their appetites. Afterward, we headed for the light deck.

We faced bun another in a circle and busted out laughing. We could suit and go into the Behemoth, reset our coordinates in the navigation module and we would be home for dinner. I had to state my case for not going back and staying right where we were. Arthropods and all. I tried to convince them that we would have the honors of seeding the first dandelions on this planet! We cold explore all the ancient flora first-paw! Or we could explore some exoplanets. We could do that and then come back tot he same spot if we don't find anything we like.

Well, Hopper said he knew exactly what he wanted, and knew exactly where his family is. Now, Mel seemed to be n the fence about this whole return thing, but Hopper was unmoved.

He said we had nothing to worry about. If we can't trust our own kind after all this time, then we have not advanced anywhere worth a pellet. This was but another test flight, just the stakes are higher. He insisted it's better fo find out where we stand sooner rather than later. Testing the boundaries and pushing them is what our hay grow from.

Hopper thought that once the lab-coats make it into the "control room" on the behemoth, the ship will reveal itself just like it did to us and that's going to be the end of the mystery. They will know what we know, no more and no less, and that will be the end of it. They won't weaponize it or turn it against us, and he meant the bunkind at large. If meat-farm days are to return, it will be done by our paws, and this whole behemoth affair will be no more than a single link a chain of events way beyond our control. On its own merits, it won't be anything but a footnote in bunkind's history. If we are that fragile, then we do have deeper issues than worries about bringing the Behemoth back home.
