X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 12

Last Week: Mr. Toes and his crew moved their ship to the spot where the stone slabs were located. The crew worked on preparing for the repairs and the end of the day they noticed some bipeds advancing in their direction.

We watched with a bit of apprehension as the bipeds inched closer and closer to us, pushing a small cart in front of them. Ava and Penny were still outside by the main hatch and they were as riveted by the development as the reasto ufs. I really wasn't worried as much about what the bipeds were going to do as I was about what Abby would order next. But all she did was to ask Ava and Penny climb a keep ene eye on the wider perimeter. Were the bipeds trying to get our attention while they plotted something out of sight? Ava and Penny didn't spot anything neferious going on behind our back though.

That's when Pancake asked if she and Molly can go and greet the bipeds. "What do you mean?' asked Abby. "Well, we want to go out there on the hover stand and see what's in that cart. Ava and Penny can cover us, Looks like all the bipeds are afraid to come out of the woods." Abby waited with response and kept  looking at the images of the cart one on of the screens. She zoomed in on the cart as much as she could, and looked of queues that would lay bare any obfuscated intentions. She finally spoke, "Pancake, wait a second, Joey fire up the loading dolly and follow them, stay close and be ready pounce. And Pancake, don't you dare getting any closer to them than a hundred feet! Got it?' 'Of course! replied Pancake. Molly fired up the hover-stand and Pancake jumped right on it, behind Molly. She put her feet into restraints and telescoped straight up with her front paws scrossed in fron of her chest. They waited for Joey. The poor guy again struggled with starting the dolly. But Pancake waited patiently until that dolly came back to life once more and Molly got them moving forward finally. 

I had a sense they did something that hover-stand but wasn't quite sure what. All was revealed in short order. As soon as they cleared they loading ramp, flames shot out from the bottom  and sides of the stand!

Somewhere from under the ship, Hopmeric showed up and chased after the hover-stand. I yelled 'Stop!' into the intercom. Molly stopped the hover-stand. 'Make room for one moe, Hopmeric was chasing after you, ' I explained. 'A who and what?' asked confused Pancake. 'Hopmeric, the hare, see if you can motion him to get on the stand,' I added. As Pancake waited, she turned toward the hare and motined him to get on the beside her, 'COME ON!' she almost yelled at him, as if her raised voice couldhelp. 'What are you tring to do?' asmked Abby. ' I want the bipeds to see the hare by our side. I wantt them to think he may as well have come down from heaven, like us.' Abby furrowed her brows, then raised them and shurgged, 'Good luck with that. You're getting emotionally involved here. Waht are going to do when we have to leave?' I didn't answer. 

Hopmeric must have gotten the idea to get on the hover-stand. Or maybe that's what he wanted to do all along? Hopmeric made a tenative move toward Panacda and Molly, then hopped right on and tried to steady himself. Pancake made a little bit of room hor him and Molly go them moving again. Hopmeric flinched as Molly let out more flames from their contraption. 

'I can't believe we had that garbage on board,' I mumbled. 'What harbage?' asked Abby without looking away from the  screen. 'Whatever it is that Molly is bruning off,' I explained. Molly kept moving forward and se were the bipeds with their cart. They didn't seem intimidated by the pyrotechics. They finally stopped and started to back away, moving back toward the woods. Then one of them turned around ran. His cohorts immediately took off and followed him. Molly roared with her flamethrowers and one of the bipeds tripped and had a hard time getting up. Hi comrades didn't even look back. 

Molly moved closer to the cart now, then pulled up alongside the cart. 'Don't get any closer to it,' said Abby anxiously. I imagined Hopmeric didn't hear or understand any of that. He lept onto the cart. It was piled with veg! A heaping pile of greens! We could make out wild blueberry branches, dill and turnips with roots and clumps of dirt on them. 'Look, cabbage!' exclaimed Molly. We saw piles of fresh grass, freshly torn off the ground. All that layed on a heap of hay, or straw, or something. Hopmeric dug right into it, stuffing himself as fast as he could. He tore off a leaf of cabbage and offered it to Molly. She looked at it and reluctantly  reached out and took the leaf.

'What do we do with that?' I asked, semi rhetorically. 'I don't know, do you think this is still a trap, do you think it's poisoned?' wondered Abby and continued, 'We could bring it in for analysis, or we cold freeze it and take it back with us. He doesn't seem to be concerned though.' Abby motined with her head toward Hopmeric who continued to feast unabashed.

Maybe an offerin is just an offering?' promposed Joey, still waiting on his dolly, behind the hover-stand. We looked at him surprised. I glanced at the panoramic infrared scan of our surroundings. The bipeds kept glowing in the distance, I pressumed watching our reaction to their offer alms. 'How about we pull the cart clsoer to the loading ramp/" asked Pancake and hooked a line to the bottom of the cart before Abby  could say yes. 

As Molly started to more bacck toward our ship, Hopemrica stood up and telescoped facing the bipeds. I swear he became twice as wide and tall as the last time I saw him stand up. He looked regal and glowed, showing the bipeds he was of the same heaven as us.
