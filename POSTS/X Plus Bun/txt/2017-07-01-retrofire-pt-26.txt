X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 26

Freddie put aside the pieces of Hopnom's suit and moved down the tunnel to where the news buns were taking care of Dr. Hopnom. Freddie told them about the potential disaster the regenerative therapy could cause. One bun dropped her mouf and the other's eyes almost popped out. What Freddie suggested was a test of the therapeutic solution against Hopnom's cells. Who prepared the solution was irrelevant since Freddie didn't trust the chain of custody of the preparation.  The lab  at the Repair Hub would have to generate a model of Hopnom's cells and then simulate the therapy with a sample of the therapeutic  compound. If Hopnom had a even the most rudimentary clearance to set foot on a space faring craft, his files would have to contain he digital extract of his DNA. 

The news buns requested the test and just in case tried to source a clean dose of the carbon nano-tube solution. Freddie and Penny paused for a bit and decided to eat something. as they grabbed their rations, they parked themselves by the control room, were the news buns made the magic happen for the news broadcast. Hopper and Mel still held the center stage and even answered some questions from the ever growing audience of the broadcast. As Freddie watched the proceedings, he had to shake his head. After surviving what we had and breaking out of the hospital, Freddie had to assure the survival of a somebun he never heard of before. He never thought that Hopper, Mel and i could need a "witness for the defense." Alas, there would be testimonies, depositions and Bun only knows how many "Warren Commissions" they would have to mollycoddle. Those power that be would never stop trying to have their way and if at first they couldn't make us disappear, at least they would try to make our lives miserable.

I was still resting in Abby's cabin when one news bun stopped by and asked if any bun of us could help with an EBA. They needed  a couple of buns to go out and strip the masking putty off the transponder sensors. Pretty soon the news ship would have to show up on the controllers' tracking equipment if we wanted to dock with the Repair Hub. Abby and I declined and the news bun went on and grabbed Joey again. He was always eager to get outside and never passed a chance to do so. I think Pancake and molly joined them to get the job done faster. the commander felt safe enough as a result of the story spreading throughout the public to pick up the pace and get to the Hub sooner.

somebun stopped by again and asked how I was doing and if I could  join them on the stage. I felt I couldn't put them off anymore. I was far from feeling fine, but I recovered well enough to get behind the mike and do my part in keeping the broadcast rolling. I will not bore you with the recount. If you want to see what I shared, you can just flip back a few pages and re-read about happened. As my bit turned from retelling of the story to answering  questions from the public, it hit me that maybe this adventure will have much deeper consequences for every bun than I originally imagined.

I saw what happened to Hopper, Mel and I as something technical. we had bad day, we did this and that to get out of it and we were able to churn enough good luck out of the mess to come back  and tell everybun about it. I started  sensing now that maybe we played a bigger role in rekindling the sense of wonder and fascination with the larger universe waiting just beyond the reach of our paws, just beyond the tips of our whiskers. Just beyond the membrane separating the mundane, complacent and taken for granted is the larger, still befuddling our imagination endless mystery. 

When we arrived at the Hub, we were greeted by a surprisingly large crowd. We suspected something was up when we saw the unusually hight number of crafts docked with the Hub and and parked near by. Freddie and Penny went to make sure the treatment for Dr. Hopnom was uncompromised. The therapeutic compound came from a lab where a trusted cohort of the news buns was on the clock and she prepared a brand new batch of the substance.

I started getting very antsy  after a couple of days at the Hub. Mel, Hopper and I decided to request time off from he Flight agency and we announced a little vacation from our official duties. At this point I had no  idea what our official duties were anymore or what they would become in the future. I had no idea what our futures held since I had the feeling that maybe we were not supposed to have any. The only reason I thought things would turn out OK for us was the fact that Dr. Hopnom started showing strong signs of recovery. He was our only insurance for having any type of serene future. 

As soon a the Buzzard was turned over to Abby and her crew, Abby and I decided to heard back to earth for an extended time of R and R. We invited Hopper and Mel to come by and stay with as for as long as they wished if things got too hot to handle. both were relieved and appreciative and in turn so was I. when everything was said and done, they three of us would be our own support group. so far, there's no bun that could related to what we've been through.
