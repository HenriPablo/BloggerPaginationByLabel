Bun Fiction Update 2017-10-28

Everybun sat in a booth already and a big pot of hot, spiced beverage waited in the middle of the table. Molly was still typing something on her device. It looked like the post mortem of the last story. It took me a second to read the reflection of her screen in the window behind her.

Soon, the hostes came by witha large salad cart and we each took a turn building our dinner salads. I picked mostly herbs and an overdose of alfalfa croutons. 

We decided to order some carrotinis. Molly put away her device, asked us what took us so long while she fiddled under the table with something. After a moment, she showed her paws holding a bunch of twigs, covering their bottoms. We were going to draw lots to see who's going to be the driver in command for the ride back tot he motel. Pancake drews first and came up long. So did Abby and Joye. Ava ent next, drew long and giggled. Penny went next. We noticed her disapproving frwon befoe we saw how short her short straw was and we all got bummed out. Pancake grabbed the short straw from Penny and shook her head, " I just don't feel it tonight. You go ahead and enjoy yourself, Penny. Then again, no bun will believe your ID anyway, so good luck  with that!" We broke into a slow burn of a polite applause and Pancake bowed with a grin!
