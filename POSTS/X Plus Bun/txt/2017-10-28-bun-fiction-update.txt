Bun Fiction Update 2017-10-28

Everybun sat in a booth and a big pot of hot, spiced beverage waited in the middle of the table. Molly was still typing something on her device. It looked like the postmortem of the last story. It took me a second to read the reflection of her screen in the window behind her.

Soon, the hostess came by with a large salad cart, and we each took a turn building our dinner salads. I picked mostly herbs and an overdose of alfalfa croûtons. 

We decided to order some carrotinis. Molly put away her device, asked us what took us so long as she fiddled under the table with something. After a moment, she showed her paws holding a bunch of twigs, covering their bottoms. We were going to draw lots to see who's going to be the driver in command for the ride back to the motel. Pancake drew first and came up long. So did Abby and Joye. Ava drew long and giggled. Penny went next. We noticed her disapproving frown before we saw how short her short straw was and we all got bummed out. Pancake shook her head and grabbed the short straw from Penny, " I just don't feel it tonight. You go ahead and enjoy yourself, Penny. Then again, no bun will believe your ID anyway, so good luck  with that!" We broke into a slow burn of a polite applause and Pancake bowed with a grin!

We were still noming our salads and waiting for the carrotinis when Pancake brought up the launch of the last story, the three-parter "One With The Void." Ava said, "I would move the part about the ship trying to contact others to the beginning of the story. Maybe even lead with it, you know. Something about a string of weird pings, penetration attacks or crack attempts that weren't. Probably just some kids messing about or something like that. We return to it later in the story and connect the dots." Penny nodded in approval and went cross eyed as she tried to make her little tongue reach a piece of a raspberry stuck to her nose. Joey wiped his mouf, looked at Pancake and Abby and asked, "Where are all the stories going? What kind of a world are they describing?" 

Penny finished a plum raspberry and licked her lips all around, almost reaching the top of her nose with her tongue and said, "We really don't know much about that space faring society. The news buns seem to be almost part of their justice system. No bun messes with them. As soon as they break the story, it's all over for the 'bad' guys, and the 'good' ones are safe. Automation seems to be 'verboten!'" There is nothing the protagonists do that couldn't be automated, and an attempt to deploy a fully autonomous system raises to the level of a crime against bunnity. What are the social structures of their society? How did they get there? Every bunny is a bunstronaut; ratties engineer, and art. I know, art as a verb, that's right."

"Yeah," started Ava, "... the big news in the story was the cover-up of the autonomous system. The real purpose of the crew of the Buzzard seemed to have been to help the news buns."

"Why is that civilization putting so much effort into their space program? What else do they do on the ground?" Joey wondered and continued, "What is life like for everybunny else? Is it their religion? Do they have a religion? Do they have some specific, long-term goals in mind? Did they populate other planets in their solar system? Are they planning to leave the system? How did they manage to survive beyond the life cycle of other civilizations, empires that collapsed or burned out like viral infections? How did they even came to be? What sort of twisted case of evolutionary biology led to them?"

I stopped eating and became lost in the storm Joey kicked up in my head. None of us noticed our waiter standing next to us with our try of carrotinis.

-- TALK ABOUT CARROTINIS AND BUZZ --

We had parked a good walk away from the diner because the place was packed and it took us for ever to find a spot that would fit out convertible. It was late October but you would never know it. It was still hot and muggy at the night. Now, crocodiles on the other paw couldn't be more pleased. Their barking croaks filled the air and we picked up our pace. My mind started to play tricks on me. Fallen trees and palms, old, ratting tree trunks across the drainage ditch  looked suspicious. I expected at any second to see yellow eyes chasing after me when something stirred in the palmetto bushes just as we got tot he car. They couldn't do anything to in car, could they? The trouble was the convertible we piled into wouldn't do us any good until we put up the top or drove away. Pancake started the car and Abby hit the button to raise and close the top. The rest of us in the back seat, Penny, Ava, Molly, Joey and me were still trying to untangle ourselves from the bun pile we had became. The cracking outside grew louder and closer. My neck started to cramp with fear. The car wouldn't start. We could hear the engine turning over abut it just wouldn't start. Pancake tried again. It came to life with a wild roar! She threw it in reverse and started peeling out of the parking spot. She hit the brakes and I hit the rear  seat, almost flying out of it as I tried to stand up and look at what was chasing us, but I couldn't  keep my balance. I found myself on the floor again between the read and front seats. Pancake stepped on the gas  and the rear wheels made a horrendous, grinding sound as they threw back tons of gravel, desperately trying to gain traction. I could feel the cart fishtailing as I tried once more to get up on my feet. Pancake flew out of the parking lot onto the empty, dark road. The smell of burning rubber made me sick as the force in the turn threw me into Joey. I steadied myself and got a clear view of what we had left behind. A pair of giant, yellow eyes was staring at us.  They were getting smaller, but I was mortified.  Then the eyes turned red! I realized I was looking into a pair traffic lights for the opposite lanes.
