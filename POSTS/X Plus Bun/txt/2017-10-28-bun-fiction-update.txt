Bun Fiction Update 2017-10-28

Everybun sat in a booth already, and a big pot of hot, spiced beverage waited in the middle of the table. Molly was still typing something on her device. It looked like the post-mortem of the last story. It took me a second to read the reflection of her screen in the window behind her.

Soon, the hostess came by with a large salad cart, and we each took a turn building our dinner salads. I picked mostly herbs and an overdose of alfalfa croutons. 

We decided to order some carrotinis. Molly put away her device, asked us what took us so long while she fiddled under the table with something. After a moment, she showed her paws holding a bunch of twigs, covering their bottoms. We were going to draw lots to see who's going to be the driver in command for the ride back tot he motel. Pancake drew first and came up long. So did Abby and Joye. Ava ent next drew long and giggled. Penny went next. We noticed her disapproving frown before we saw how short her short straw was and we all got bummed out. Pancake grabbed the short straw from Penny and shook her head, " I just don't feel it tonight. You go ahead and enjoy yourself, Penny. Then again, no bun will believe your ID anyway, so good luck  with that!" We broke into a slow burn of a polite applause and Pancake bowed with a grin!

We were still noming our salads and waiting for the carrotinis when Pancake brought up the launch of the last story, the three-part "One With The Void." Ava said, "I would move the part about the ship trying to contact others to the beginning of the story. Maybe even lead with it, you know. There had been this string of weird pings, penetration attacks or crack attempts that weren't and we never knew what they were. Probably some kids messing about. Or something like that. We return to it later in the story and connect the dots." Penny nodded in approval and went cross eyes as she tried to reach a piece of a raspberry stuck on her nose with her tongue. Joey wiped his mouf, looked at Pancake and Abby and asked, "Where are all the stories going? What kind of a world are they describing?" I couldn't tell if we were silent because the question was good or because the salad was so yameh. 

Penny finished a plum raspberry and licked her lips all around, almost reaching the top of her nose with her tongue and said, "We really don't know much about that space faring society. The news buns seem to be almost part of their justice system. No bun messes with them. As soon as they break the story, it's all over for the 'bad' guys, and the 'good' ones are safe. Automation seems to be 'verboten.'" There's nothing the protagonists do that couldn't be automated, and an attempt at a fully autonomous system raises to the level of a crime against bunnity. What are the social structures of their society? How did they get there? Every bunny is a bunstronaut, ratties engineer, and art. I know, art as a very, that's right."

"Yeah," started Ava, "... the big news in the story was the cover-up of the autonomous system. The crew of the Buzzard seemed to be there to help the news buns."

"Why is that civilization putting so much effort into their space program? What else do they do on the ground?" Joey wondered and continued, "What is life like for everybunny else on the ground. Is it their religion of some sort? Do they have some specific, long-term goals in mind? Did they populate other plants in the solar system? Are they doing something on Mars? Are they planning to leave the system? How did they manage to survive beyond the life cycle of other civilizations, empires and such?"

I stopped eating and became lost in the storm Joey kicked up in my head. None of us noticed our waiter standing next to us with our try of carrotinis.
