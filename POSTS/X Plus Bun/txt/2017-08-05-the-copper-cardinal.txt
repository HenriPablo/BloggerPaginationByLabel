X-Plus Bun - The Copper Cardinal
It was still dark outside, but Molly cold feel the sunrise was but a few degrees of rotation away. The birds were up and singing away, trying to get as much business done before the day turn into a scorcher. She turned on the dim, overhead light in her workshop and sat down to testing her special sunglasses. She taped a tiny controller to a willow twig and put the twig in her mouf pretending to chew on it. As she tested the controller with her teeth, by pressing one of the the sensors, something whirred and clicked in a form cooler sitting on the floor beside her.

Molly sat in her chair,  in a dim room with her shades on, looking about the room with a piece of willow hanging off her mouf. The sky was getting lighter outside. Pretty soon Pancake would be up and out in the field, pulling weeds in the tomato patch. Molly made herself comfortable in the chair and looked about the room again. Every time she focused on something, she pressed the sensor tide to the willow twig in her mouf and pair of red markers converged on that spot.
