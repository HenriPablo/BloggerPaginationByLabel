X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 16

As the gravity continued to intensify, slowly but surely, toward the 1.0 mark, I enjoyed the weight of the blanket that covered me all the way up to my nose. I had to shut the blind on the huge, panoramic window in my pod. I was getting sick. The section of the hospital base that has the artificial gravity imitates it the old-fashioned way, by spinning like weavers wheel. I had two looks at the planet below, whizzing by, and that was it. I elected not to project any static images on the huge white space. I thought that maybe I'd work on that the next day. 

All I could do now is to forget about the day, about the day tomorrow, and the day after that. I fell asleep contemplating the possible consequences of any errors in our calculations for the automated broadcast of the SOS message from our old training craft. We had hoped it would broadcast two weeks after our return. What if it already tried to broadcast; to hundred years ago. Or what if it already had fifty years to go before it would start?

I had no idea how Hopper and Mel were doing. I could only imagine that they were going through a similar experience. Tests and debriefings followed by the same test and the same debriefings. I was still raw from the welcome back we had gotten. I refused to distract myself with any alternative reality that was made available me. Every technician and Intelligence Apparatus Officer insisted on conducting the interviews at some fancy meadow by the woods or in some tropical carrot garden, but I insisted on the here and now. I think they just hated this place as much as any sane bun would. It occurred to me that they wanted to change the scenery for their amusement rather than to make it easier to get something out of me that the last bun couldn't. 

Thinking about Mel and Hopper, would try to gently tap and knock on the wall o my pod, hoping to hear a response, but the walls remained silent, no bun tapped back.

The Buzzard docked with the repair hub, and the crew disembarked. Repair technicians warmed the aging craft and looked for the airlock leaks. They probably wondered why such an old tub was still in service.

Pancake headed for the salad bar, and every bunny followed her; even Freddie. This wasn't home food by any means, but it wasn't the worst either. As soon as they started to work on a romaine and spinach bouquet, a small crew in all white and orange fatigues sat down at the next table and started on their own heap of greens. Freddie perked up immediately. He had a hunch they were up to something interesting. You don't see that many bio-hazards crews around, especially the kind that try not to draw any attention to themselves.

Penny and Ava noticed them, and they both looked at Freddie. All three paused and froze for a moment. Then Ava got up, wiped her mouf and asked a touch too loudly, "Which way are the litter bins here?" "Down the tunnel and to your left." pointed Freddie. Penny got up and following Ava, floated away, going right past the sign pointing to the litter bins. Instead, they drifted toward the tunnel leading to the Command and Communications module of the hub. Abby put on a very disinterested face and pretended to be lost in her thoughts. Joey, on the other paw, started fidgeting and washing his mouf nervously until Abby kicked him under the table. Pancake tried to contain her laughter and hid her head in a container of arugula. 

Freddie got up, checked his watch decided he had to go to get ready to catch his ride. He winded at Pancake. She pretended not to notice. They bio-hazard crew t the next table was deep in reading something and paid no attention to anybun. Freddie pushed off and slowly floated away. Penny and were still gone. A few more silent minutes went by. 

Abby started to come back t life a little bit. Joye's nervous energy started to rub off on her. Then, a commotion broke out among the bio-hazard crew. They started to argue and gesticulate wildly before they realized everybun in the place was staring at them. They calmed down and pretended to carry on as usual, but it was too late. Finally, they got up and floated off toward the docking modules. Lo and behold, right before they disappeared into the tunnel, Freddie, Penny, and Ava approached them. After some short introduction and a brief chat, too distant to be heard by Pancake and the others, Penny, Ava, and Freddie came back to the table in a hurry. 

"Sorry guy, we have a slight change in plans. We're going to St. Cinnamon's with that bio-hazard lot!" grinned Freddie.
"We've got to get some our stuff; we're undocking in a couple of hours!" chippered Penny.

Abby was stunned. Her heart was attempting a world speed record. Her biometric sensors lit up so red, they almost melted.
"Of course, it's amazing how fast the flight manifests can change these days." said Abby, trying to sound nonchalant.

Freddie's original idea involved a ride to the surface and an unannounced visit to the Director of Emergency Operations. Freddie wasn't sure how he would present his case for transparency regarding the fate of the three survivors from the missing training craft that no bun was supposed to know about. He contemplated leading, blackmailing, and threats of unspecified violent nature toward the director. Now, Freddie had a chance to see for himself what's happening in that hospital on high orbit. He knew he still had to visit the Director sooner rather than later, but now he had a chance to build his case.

Freddie, Penny, and Ava hugged everybun and promised to be back soon. 
"Good luck troubleshooting that air purifier!" grinned Pancake as she waved at them. 
"Yeah, I think we need a vacation. This is as good a place as any for doing nothing," said Abby. After long, quiet moment she wondered, "Pancake, do you really think they'll find something?"
"As long as there's something to be found, they will dig it up, I'm sure." responded Pancake with strained certainty.
