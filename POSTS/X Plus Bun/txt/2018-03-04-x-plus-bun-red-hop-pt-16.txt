X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 16

"We looked at Abby puzzled, and pancake asked, 'What lucky break are you talking about?' We had a piece of chronochromium dioxide on the table that probably came from that cloud of debris we had hit before reentry. Pancake was not impressed, 'If you look closely at the hull of this ship, you can probably scrape off a ton of icon and nickel that came from that cloud. I still don't see how this is helping us.'

That's when I got a queasy feeling in my gut. I knew what Abby had in mind. She must have noticed my grimace because she looked at me with a mischievous smile and said, 'when we got on orbit, we can inject it into the reactor and make it backfire. It will probably blow us up into quarks, but going through the ensuing rip in the fabric of time-space will send us back to where we came from. We will be mixed with that chronochromium dioxide and that stuff like to gravitate toward when it came from!'

Molly thumped, Joey almost fainted and had to sit down. Hopmeric dropped bunch pellet as if he understood anything. Pancake just kept staring forward as if she had seen a ghost of herself and didn't say a word. Ava and Penny, not amused, groaned. My legs felt a little rubbery. Would I have to say goodbye to myself? Would it be appropriate now to try and kiss my own duff goodbye? Should I write a note to the other me, the one that is going to get reconstituted? Do I get a fresh start on that other, same old side? Can I tweak myself when I get reconstituted? Could I see my mum again, but keep all the stuff I've been through until now?

'... hey,' somebun was scratching me behind the ear, '... are you OK?' at first, I didn't recognize Abby. 'Yeah, I'm OK,' I tried to mumble. 'We've got no other options. It's either that or we stay here. I guess we could vote on it.' Everybun around me shook their heads 'no,' there would be no vote on it. I agreed with them.

Hopmeric sat there, tilting his head sideways and thumping from time to time. Part of him had known this would be no picnic for us. Everybun except me followed Abby to the engine room. They were gone for the rest of the day trying to figure out how to feed the chronochromium dioxide into the reactor at the right time. I crawled under my couch and pulled out a titanium thermos I hid for times like these. I took off the screw top cup from the bottle and poured into it the carrotini from the bottle I took a swig and showed Hopmeric how to do the same. The poor guy tried to get his mouf into the cup and spilled half of it on himself. Once got a taste of the stuff, his mouf twisted and his eyes crossed, but then he got used to it and slurped the rest. I filled the cup again, and we repeated the ritual. He minded it less and less.

I woke up shivering in the middle of the night and wondered what happened. Hopmeric was on the couch next to me, somebun took pity on him and covered him up with a blankie. He kept gritting his teeth, and his mouf kept twitching. I went to the litter bin, and the looked for a blanket. before crawling back into my couch I saw a note in Abby's paw writing, 'You're patching the skin first thing in the morning!'

The next morning I got Joey to help me work on the skid. We collected all the chronochromium dioxide into a pale and cleaned out the 'wound' in the skid. Only after that, we could get a proper look at the extent of the damage. All seemed to be intact, but we had to fill the breach in the bottom of the skid. The impact was so deep that we used up almost all of the composite paste we had! Hopmeric sat and watched us. Sometimes he went inside the ship and followed Abby and the rest. 

By night time we finished all the repair chores. The next day we would complete the modifications of the reactor, and we would try to leave this place. Once we would pull up the loading ramp, this would be it.

We build a fire that night, right under the nose of the ship and we had a feast. Hopmeric sensed our time together was coming to a close, but he showed no inclination to follow us into the unknown. Before we went inside for the last time, Pancake looked over his wounded hock. There was no sign of pus. It appeared the treatment worked. We all noticed he started doing strange things with his paws. He was gripping better. Will he mind the price he was going to pay for getter his otherwise lethal wound healed? Pancake scrubbed him one more time to make sure he wouldn't carry back with him any germs his kin couldn't cope with. He looked at us one more time, thumped and turned around to run into the woods. Once he took off, we put out the fire and headed inside. No bun said a word. I felt like crying."
