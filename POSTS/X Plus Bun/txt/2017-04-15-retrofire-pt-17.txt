X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 17

After dinner, when penny and Freddie left for St. Cinnamon's, Abby invited everybun for carrotinis on the greenhouse deck. The Buzzard would have to stay docked at the maintenance hub for quiet a bit longer. Thus its crew had the perfect excuse for an impromptu vacation. The technicians found nothing wrong with the airlocks, and they found no airlock leaks. But they did find all sorts of maintenance issues that the head of maintenance would not defer anymore, and the maintenance chief refused to sign off the maintenance logs. As of six in the evening, local time, the Buzzard was declared not space-worthy.

Abby truly couldn't care less and turned the ship over to Pancake and Molly. They, of course, went on to negotiate the minimum of items that had to be inspected, replaced, tested and poked with a screwdriver before the grumpy lop would relent and release the Buzzard back to service.

This could not have happened at a better time. Abby needed a break. The problem was not with what she was doing, but with what she was not. She was absent as the captain of the ship. So far, everybun around her stepped up, and life went on, but that's only because the crew worked so well together. Under normal circumstances, they should have declared Abby incapacitated and unable to carry out her duties. But that would involve paperwork and no bun like paperwork, nor paper, unless it can be nomed, of course.

They were all going out on the limb for her, hoping that any minute now she'll come back with a grip on things; any minute now. The alternatives were simply beyond contemplation for everybun.

While Molly and Pancake tried to haggle with and smooth-talk, the maintenance chief, Joey, Penny, and Abby arrived at the greenhouse module, which also served as the observation deck of the hub. They got their sippy bags with carrotinis and went to look for a secluded spot where they could be by themselves and away from news and the prying eyes of onlookers. Word started to get around that "they knew Mr. Toes." They found a spot around overgrown birds of paradise. Some of them were blooming. There were a lot of giant ferns and other faux-prehistoric flora specimens recreated in the labs. The air was warm and a little bit humid in this part of the greenhouse.  Joey brought snacks of fruit and alfalfa. They settled into stillness and watched the traffic coming and going from the hub against the bright, starry night. The streaking ships looked liked unruly moviegoers running in front of the movie screen.

Finally, still gazing at the stars, Abby broke the silence, "Ava, how did Penny and Freddie end up getting on the flight to St. Cinnamon's?"
Ava tried to clear her throat and started impishly, "Well, somebun left a com terminal unattended, and Freddie couldn't help himself. No bun thought much about a senior engineer working on the terminal. T
hey were busy getting that resupply ship ready for the rest of its trip to St. Cinnamon. Freddie saw that he could authorize himself as a commander into that ship's system and so he did.  Next thing you knew, the bio-hazard guys had an amendment to their manifest, and they needed someone like Freddie. He, of course, thought it would be perfect for Penny to go along and get some creative life experience." Ava grinned at Abby, but she only nodded and said nothing.

Freddie and Penny kept a low profile once they boarded the resupply ship. Its skipper was rather suspicious of the sudden change in the ships manifest. Such changes happened on occasions,  but in this case, the very thing that made him suspicious prevented him from pursuing this matter any further. Anything and any bunny connected with the activities regarding the St. Cinnamon's base,  was under the control of the Directorate of Emergency Operations. That made lives tedious and arduous for ship captains and anybun supporting them, such as crew members, maintenance personnel, loadmasters and such. Any hazmat buns had their paws full with paperwork and preparations. 

So the captain twitched his nose as if he smelled something but ultimately had to turn his attention to getting his craft ready for departure.

Freddie knew that he dodged a bullet and was grateful for the first chance he got to get out of every bum's sight. He and Penny took their bags and retreated to their cabins. As they settled in and the minutes and seconds were counting down toward the ship's undocking. Freddie began to fathom the depths of the trouble he and Penny were in. 

He knew it was only a matter of time before the captain and the personnel at St. Cinnamon's realize that Freddie cracked the manifest and that there is no emergency at the hospital involving the air purification system. The only question remained was how Freddie would pay for bending reality to his will. The thought of it wore him out, so Freddie unstowed a blanket and wrapped himself in it and resolved to take a good, long nap. One thing Freddie was not going to do, is to back out of his plan. He was going to St. Cinnamon's thus he may as well sleep on it and see what pops out on the other side of the nap.

Unfortunately, the tentacles of the dark cloud that strangled Freddie's jolly disposition started to reach out for Penny. Before they had a chance to tickle her, Penny took off for the mess hall. Out of politeness, she asked Freddie if she can bring him anything, but he was already snoring. Relieved, Penny made a B-line from their quarters. Maybe she could learn something useful about the latest developments at St. Cinnamon or even that mystery ship that started this entire chain of events.
