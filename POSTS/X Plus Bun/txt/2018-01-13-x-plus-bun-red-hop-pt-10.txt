X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 10

"We inspected a couple more of those stone slabs and we headed back t our shuttle. I t was almost dark and Joye climbed to stay above the swelling fog. I opened my visor again and felt the cool, evening air, almost turning into mist. 'Put in on autopilot and pop your visor,' I said to Joey. After a moment I heard the murmurs of Joey's visor going up. Joey slowed down a little and climbed a few more feet. We were floating above a calm sea of clouds, sprawled out on the ground, too lazy lazy raise. Even the tops of the tallest of firs were drowning in the raising, featureless deluge of white and gray mist. Finally, pink glow ahead of us tried to break through the for, feebly throwing up incongruous  drop of color in the thickening, cloudy soup of early evening. 

We slowed down again as we homed in on the ship and its landing bay. The scooter slowed to a crawl as we entered the bay. The main hatch closed behind us before Joey had chance to shut down the engine. It  felt good to home. Without saying a word or waiting for anybun, I went straight to the flight deck and to the adjacent pantry. I warmed up some chamomile and garbed a hay bar. By the time I came back tot he flight deck, everybun was there. Even Penny and Molly. I was going to open the discussion by stating just how screwed I though we were, but I bit my tongue at the last second. Instead, I asked, 'You didn't pick up any sat signals, did you?' They just nodded 'no.'

'I have the ship ready to reposition.' said Ava dryly, trying to hid her resignation. 'We have found a spool of carbon line and we're working on a winch to pull those blocks,' said Penny. 'At least they were keeping busy,' I thought. 'That's great!' I tried to sound encouraging, and added, 'Abby, Pancake, anything else?'
'Look, I think we can disable the actuators retracting the skids except  for the damaged one. This way even the sandstone slabs should be strong enough to support the ship,' said Pancake. That was the first good news we had since we got here.

Shortly after we called it a night. We didn't even bother pretending to keep a night watch. The bipeds could kiss our thrusters, if they could reach them. Maybe tonight would be the night we got some real, proper sleep. 

Morning was a flurry of busy work. To move the ship such a short distance required almost as much work as going on orbit. At first we wanted to go into over mode and plough through the woods, heading straight for the clearing where those slabs were. Ava suggested ascending above the cloud deck and descending straight down. If there were any bipeds around, they would see us descend from the sky. That would give them something to think about. 'Fry 'em' interrupted Molly. 

'Anyway,' Ava continued, '... let's see how they react. Fending them off would be a lot of work. Who knows, maybe we can get them to help us?' 'Really, Ava? You wanna make a deal with the devil? Do you thing they traded with the bears for those skins? Oh, shucks, I wonder what you could get for your hide, Ava?' Abby cleared her throat and thumped gently, 'Look here, Molly. I've no idea how we got here. I'm just trying to get us the hay out of here, and whatever I can do to speed this up, I'm going to do it! If I have to trade with things, I will. We have not the the technology with us to 'fix' them! Let's say we could rework their DNA. We can't do that with what we got. We don't have enough fuel to try 'em all or the means of finding each and every one of them! Now, unless you have an idea on how to do all that with what we got, can it. See what else is in that storage bay next to the power plant. Maybe you could put together a jet pack for yourself.'

We stood there in silence, I felt for Molly, I had the same urges. Had she gone off the deep end and went out there with an antimatter blaster to lay waste to the bipeds, I would be right with her. Except  what would be the point?'

'Um, we could really use some pulleys, maybe another winch,' Pancake broke the silence. 'OK, let's move this thing,' said Abby softly.

'Molly, let's see what else is in the storage. You all don't need us to move the ship, do you?' asked Pancake as she turned toward Molly and gave her quick rub between the ears. The rest of us took our seats and Abby started on the preflight checklist.
