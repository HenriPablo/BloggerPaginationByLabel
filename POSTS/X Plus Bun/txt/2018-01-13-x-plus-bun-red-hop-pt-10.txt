X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 10

"It was almost dark, and Joye climbed to stay above the swelling fog. 'Major, what do you make of that, ... that hare?' Asked Joey. Then Abby chimed in as I knew she would, 'You are lucky that you are still in one piece, Major. That could have been a wolf or a wildcat. You get yours when you get here! What were you thinking?' 'You saw what I saw; you tell me what that was about. We can go over the video recording once we come back,' I tried to brush off their nagging. I opened my visor again and felt the cool, evening air, almost turning into mist. 'Put in on autopilot and pop your visor,' I said to Joey. Shortly after, I heard the murmur of Joey's visor going up. Joey slowed down a little and climbed a few more feet. We were floating above a calm sea of clouds, sprawled out on the ground, too lazy to raise. Even the tops of the tallest of firs were drowning in the raising, featureless deluge of white and gray mist. Finally, pink glow ahead of us tried to break through the fog, feebly bleeding a drop of color in the thickening, cloudy soup of early evening. 

We slowed down again as we homed in on the ship. The scooter slowed to a crawl as we entered the loading bay. The main hatch closed behind us before Joey had a chance to shut down the engine. It felt great to be back home. Without saying a word or waiting for anybun, I went straight past the flight deck and to the adjacent pantry. I warmed up some chamomile and garbed a hay bar. By the time I came back tot he flight deck, everybun was there. Even Penny and Molly. They were watching my encounter with the indigenous hare over and over. No bun recognized him. I'm not even sure when or how we decided it was him and not her. You would think that space travel would offer an encounter with strange creatures that are somehow nothing like what we had imagined them to be, and instead, you end up in front of a mirror. This business reveals stuff about ourselves more than anything else. 

I was going to ignore the orange hare and open the discussion by stating just how screwed I thought we were, but I bit my tongue at the last second. Instead, I asked, 'You didn't pick up any sat signals, did you?' They just nodded 'no.' 'I have the ship ready to reposition.' said Ava dryly, trying to hide her resignation. 'We have found a spool of carbon line, and we're working on a winch to pull those blocks,' said Penny. 'At least they were keeping busy,' I thought. 'That's great!' I tried to sound encouraging, and added, 'Abby, Pancake, anything else?'
'Look, I think we can disable the actuators retracting the skids except for the damaged one. This way even the sandstone slabs should be strong enough to support the ship,' said Pancake. That was the first good news we had since we got here.

We tried to call it a night early, but once the conversation again turned to the hare, we called him Hopmeric, we stayed up way too late. Afterwards, we didn't even bother pretending to set up a night watch. The bipeds could kiss our thrusters if they could reach them. We would try to get some proper sleep some other night. 

The morning was a flurry of busy work. To move the ship such a short distance required almost as much work as going on orbit. At first, we wanted to go into hover mode, plough through the woods, and head straight for the clearing where those slabs were. Ava suggested ascending above the cloud deck and descending straight down over the clearing. If there were any bipeds around, they would see us descend from the sky. That would give them something to think about. 'Fry 'em' interrupted Molly. 

'Anyway,' Ava continued, '... let's see how they react. Fending them off would be a lot of work. Who knows, maybe we can get them to help us?' Molly raised her voice, 'Really, Ava? You wanna make a deal with the devil? Do you think they traded with the bears for those skins? Oh, shucks, I wonder what you could get for your hide, Ava?' Abby cleared her throat and thumped gently, 'Look here, Molly, I'm just trying to get us the hay out of here, and whatever I can do to speed this up, I'm going to do it. If I have to trade with those things, I will. We have not the technology with us to 'fix' them! Let's say we could rework their DNA. We can't do that with what we got. We don't have enough fuel to "fry 'em all" or the means to find each and every one of them! Now, unless you have an idea on how to do all that with what we got, drop it. See what else is in that storage bay next to the power plant.'

We stood there in silence, and I felt for Molly. I had the same urges. Had she gone off the deep end and went out there with an antimatter blaster to lay waste to the bipeds, I would be right with her. Except, what would be the point?'

'Um, we could use some pulleys, maybe another winch,' Pancake broke the silence. Abby looked around the room and said softly, 'OK, let's move this thing.'

'Molly, let's see what else is in the storage. You all don't need us to move the ship, do you?' Asked Pancake as she turned toward Molly and gave her quick rub between the ears. The rest of us took our seats, and Abby started on the preflight checklist.
