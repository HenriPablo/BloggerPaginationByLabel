Sidney and the Bunstronauts

It was Sidney's first Christmas and her uncle Tomek had sent her a special present he called Sinularia.  She looked like a small plush pillow that reminded Sidney of a cloud.  

In the middle of the night, Sidney awoke to a sound like a helicopter if helicopters were had large soft rabbit ears for perpelers.  
--
She crawled toward the Christmas tree which seemed to be the source of the strange sound....

Many miles above the Earth, Zoomer was preparing a very special delivery.  The Bunstronauts had decided that they needed to give Sidney a very special welcome.

They wanted to show Sidney the beautiful place that is her home, as they saw it from space.
--
Sidney crawled under the Christmas tree and placed her head on Singularia.  Singularia whispered to the baby:  "Sweet Girl, would you like to go on an adventure?"
--
And, since she is the very bravest baby that ever blew a raspberry, she blinked her eyes two times, which meant yes in Babese.  

The Bunstronauts had developed their vessel, the Red Hop, to be the safest of ships.

The pilot of Red Hop was named Abby, Abby and her copilot and chief scientist Mr. Toes.  Toes stood on Abby's left side and gazed at Red Hop.  They were both thinking of their mission to fly with Sidney.  Would she like flying?
--
The time had come.  Sidney had accepted the mission.  Abby piloted Red Hop to the rendezvous.  Sidney would board the Red Hop through a special portal Singularia would open under the tree.
--
On board the Red Hop Mr. Toes was monitoring all of the equipment, making sure all of the instruments were working properly.  Everything must go perfectly for Sidney's first mission to space.
--
Abby watched the trajectories of all of the other objects near them in low Earth orbit.

She never tired of seeing the stars and the moon and of course, the magical Earth.
--
Abby was ready for Sidney to board the Red Hop but it would be another half hour as Singularia created a wormhole just the right size and shape for Sidney to crawl through.  Abby closed her eyes for just a short wink.
--
Sidney had finally made it to the ship!

But Abby didn't want the baby to bump her head in zero gravity, so Sidney was given her own space chair. 
--
The bunstronauts explained to Sidney that they wanted to show her the magnificent home that she was traveling on and to welcome her to this new home.  Her uncle Tomek had told them all about her, but she had lots of questions for them.  After they talked for a long time they all watched the blue Earth together in silence.  Toes stood as close to the window as he could.
--
All too soon, it was time for Sidney to travel home.  The Buns all gave her hugs and kisses.  Sidney was getting sleepy now.  Singularia created a new path for her to travel.  She waved goodbye one final time and headed home.  

When morning came, Mommy and Daddy found her sound asleep under the tree, dreaming of countless stars.
