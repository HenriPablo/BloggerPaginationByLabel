X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 20


By night time we finished all the repair chores. The next day we would complete the modifications of the reactor, and try to leave this place. Once the loading ramp came up, this would be it.

We build a fire that night, right under the nose of the ship and we had a feast. Hopmeric sensed our time together was coming to a close but showed no inclination to follow us into the unknown. Before we went inside for the last time, Pancake looked over his wounded hock. It appeared the treatment worked and there was no sign of pus. We all noticed he started doing strange things with his paws. He was starting to grip. Will he mind the price he was going to pay for getting this, otherwise lethal, wound healed? Pancake scrubbed him one more time to make sure he wouldn't carry back any germs his kin couldn't cope with. He looked at us, thumped, turned around and run for the woods. We put out the fire and headed inside. No bun said a word. I felt like crying.
