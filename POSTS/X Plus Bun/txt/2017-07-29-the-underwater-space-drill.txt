X-Plus Bun - The Underwater Space Drill

"Any updates?" I asked Pancake again. She had to be getting seriously irritate by my nervous queries, but she didn't show it. The atmospheric pressure was dropping and the storm was still ways out, but in my head it was already here. I asked myself again why or how I ended up on an oceanographic vessel anchored at xx.xx and xx.xx and I didn't know. We were over one of the largest sandbars on the planet and when the tide got low enough, you could see the murky bottom. I looked at the space drill mounted in the middle of the drilling deck and wondered how they ever managed to get it here. It wasn't designed to operate in the 1 G environment of the planet's sea level. The deck was swarming with young bunletts, curious and giddy, proud for taking part in this assignment. They didn't mind giving up their summer break at the university, they didn't mind nor read the fine print, they didn't mind getting sworn into secrecy. I wondered if they comprehended what it meant?

Every time the drill registered a strata sample they poured over the monitor and scratched their heads and argued.  

I remember this one story my great grandpa to the Nth power told me about a crew making a deorbit flight. They died because their craft suffered a thermal protection breach in one of the wings. Why would he tell me something like that; right before bedtime; when I was tiny? I would tell a story like that because that's just me, but my great grandpa? That's no way to raise your little ones. As if that wasn't bad enough, he kept scaring us with stories about these mythical creatures called the "hoomins" who inhabited our planet long, long ago and kept us as pets. That's what he would tell us when we wanted nanners instead of hay for dinner, "Eat your hay or the hoomins will get you at night." I'll spare you the recipes.
