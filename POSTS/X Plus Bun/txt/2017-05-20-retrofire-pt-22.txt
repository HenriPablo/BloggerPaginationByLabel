X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 22

AUTHOR'S NOTE: Hopper, Mel, and Mr. Toes triggered a major incident at the St. Cinnamon's station and the facility is in danger disintegrating. The three bunstronauts are working their way toward the hospital's shuttle deck.

We were about to turn into the tunnel leading to the central part of the station, the "axle" around which the circular part of the hospital rotated. Mel, leading the way, stopped abruptly and turned around crushed into Hopper who didn't realize what happened. Mel moved back, turned to his left, right in front of me and opened a door room. It was one of the nurses' station. I didn't even notice it. Mel got on a terminal, and as he started typing something,  he pointed to a locker in the wall and asked Hooper to open it.

"Don't panic, guys. We need to love our monitors. I'm disabling our old ones. Hopper get those blank ones, would you?" said Mel. Hopper handed him three little boxes containing the blank monitors. Mel took them and one by one initialized them with our current data.  He handed us the little monitor beads that were about the size of a half a lingonberry, and we left the room. 

We went back a few steps again and entered an emergency life support pod. It acted like a shelter, providing basic life support functionality in case of a fire or pressure loss in the hospital. We glued our monitor beads to the beds with a little adhesive paste. Hopper grabbed some food packs and water pouches and handed them to us. "We may not need them, but you never know," said Hopper.

Mel grabbed the food packs, got out and headed for a junction. "Mel, stop!" yelled Hopper. Mel turned around with a puzzled look on his mouf. Hopper pointed to a locker with scrubs. It took me second to catch to what Hopper had in mind. 
"Who are you gonna fool, Hopper? Look at this place; there are patients here, we are it. I pointed to a screen showing zero beds occupied. Officially,  We didn't even exist. After a second I said, "What the hey, grab a few, Hopper!"
"Right, let's use the maintenance tunnel, just in case." said Hopper as he grabbed three sets of white scrubs.

We looked for and got into the first maintenance junction we found. From there, it was a straight line running toward the central section of the hospital.  If the pods we just escaped from were located on the outer edge of a giant wheel with spokes, we were moving along in one of those spokes toward the axle. 

I could feel through feet the imbalanced rotation of the wheel as we made slow progress. We worked hard against the centrifugal force pushing us out toward the outer rim of the wheel. At least the tunnel was empty. All the airlocks were open as far as bun could see. We got lighter the closer we got the center, and we started to work more and more with our front paws, pullings ourselves forward more than pushing off with the feet. Once we've made it to the last junction, we looked through the little window int the door to see if anybun was out there. It was quiet. One or two buns would flat by thing way or that. We decided to change into the orderlies scrubs before we got out. The central segment of the station was straining under forces placed on it by the out of balance rotating wheel. We could hear the creaks and bangs of the stressed sections. 

We checked around one more time and in a moment when there was no bun around, we floated out into the main tunnel. We headed for the main shuttle deck. Next to it were a series of large storage bays and auxiliary control station. If we could lock ourselves in it, we could monitor what's going on. If they were going to evacuate the station, the rescue vessels were most likely to dock here. Or we might have to take our chances in one of the shuttle crafts.

The news ship with Abby and everybun else on board was closing in on the hospital monitored all the communication channels known to them. A couple of news buns were checking the setup of a live broadcast studio, just in case a story broke, and there was something to tell the public at large. They tried to arrange for a relay of their broadcasts, if any were to be had, by a few small, independent news organizations. 

when the hospital started to experience the results sabotage, perpetrated by Mr. Toes and his crew guys and broke its radio silence, the news buns picked it up.
"We have a signal from St. Cinnamon!" somebun blared on the intercom. Abby, pancake and the rest sprung for the flight deck. They watched the transmission roll up the monitor. It was all generic telemetry. It only listed crew members as souls on board, no patients. Molly and Pancake looked at each other puzzled. They picked up a response signal from a supply ship, giving its location, direction flight, and other technical minutiae. It intended to rendezvous with the hospital and was ready to accept any evacuees if necessary.
"That's the ship with penny and Freddie!" exclaimed Ava. The supply ship was almost ready to dock with the hospital. 

Then, the distress signal from the hospital died, mid cycle. If the emergency was resolved, everybun expected a resolution transmission to be aired next.  But no such thing happened. Shortly after, some official news sources mentioned, almost in passing, that the hospital was conducting emergency preparedness exercises.
