It's been a long and arduous week at our local bunstronaut office. The arrival of Charlie put Latte and me on edge.
Our hoomin was very distraught over that and felt we became unbonded :-(
But, we worked it out and by Friday Latte, and I were on snorgling terms again. Of course, our hoomins try to bribe us
with treats more often than they should, but I don't complain.

I hear that this Charlie girl is very sweet and friendly. Well sweet and friendly with our hoomins at least. This mess
I'm in with Latte doesn't feel to me very sweet nor friendly. OK, OK, I know, it's been a week, so we'll have to give it
a little more time, maybe "little" months of that time.
We'll keep you posted.
