X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 11

It took us much longer to nail down the numbers for inserting our training  craft into the Saturn's orbit. We had to find a window far ahead to give give us some time to prepare our evacuation. Then we had to double check them. I really missed not having a team on the ground to offer assistance at a moment like this. By the time we got done we were all jittery. It's been so long since any of us had to calculate trajectories that we all felt like beginners. At least Hopper and Mel were relatively fresh graduates from training so they handled the pressure well. I, on the other paw, felt completely humbled.

Maybe it wasn't the calculations that got us all wobbly. In a round about way, the math implied finality of our stay at our present space-time coordinates. 

Afterwards we feasted on all the fresh supplies that we had left. There was no sense trying to preserve anything. If we didn't eat it then, it would just go to waste. Our moods lifted a little and I dispensed sleeping aids again. even after that I felt restless and anxious in my improvised burrow. I could hear Hopper and Mel wrestling uneasily too. 

The next day we started to dismantle a part of the aft storage pay go gain access to the flight data recorder modules. It took us most of the day because those parts were never meant to be accessed the way we had to get to them. Hopper thought it would be a good idea to bring them with us and maybe engineering would be able to make sense of what happened to us. Of course, if those modules got wiped clean when our incident occurred, this was just a huge waste of time and effort.

The physical workout helped us all to steady our nerves. I realized how much I missed the workout equipment available on larger ships. We should have  improvised some resistance training contraption to minimize the loss of strength, but for now, I would have to leave it in the "lessons learned" rubric. We were about to bail out of here anyway.

While Hopper got buzy preparing our suits, I helped Mel with the main cmputer system. We had to repurpose one of the backup system to act as a flight recorder. Without that, the proper data recorder module would not release from it's seating. Or to be more precise, the main computer would not release the latches on the module. We had the recorder out of the bay and in the airlock in no time.

Next. Mel started crafting the SOS , or "here's what happened to us" story for broadcast. It ended with something to the effect of "If you are listening to this message, we've been locked up somewhere in a government facilities and we sure could use a rescue." Would that signal ever be pickup by anybun? I never hope to find out. Our craft had a very limited possibilities for broadcasting so I didn't put too much hope in  a regular radio and microwave frequencies getting picked up. Both the pods from the Behemoth on the other paw would beam in in x-rays. That ought to be interesting. We had hoped it would be noticed by radio-telescopes on the ground and on orbit.

Of course the chances of our craft still being semi-functional so far in the future were overly optimistic, but we had to do our due  diligence. Hopper giggled that if anything happens to us, the pods from the Behemoth will do some wonders to x-ray scanners and other machines of that sort. "Imagine, you go to a see your dentist for a filling and your bill contains a misfortune cookie: 'Help me, I'm held hostage in a lab,'" quipped Mel. 

We had one more thing to do before we could leave. The extended life support system. We wanted the means of recharging our suits. We had to be able to replenish the breathable oxygen and carbon monoxide scrubbers. The scrubbers were easy to replace.  We grabbed whatever scrubbers were left in the emergency supply bay. The oxygen system was a bit more tricky. We removed a small cold storage compartment lining . We added a couple of liquid  oxygen bottle with a heating system. We cannibalized spare EBA suit to make a charging adapter to able able to transfer the oxygen from the support unit into a high pressure suit containers. We gathered all the spare batteries to run the pressure pumps. It worked, but barely. the support system could produce enough pressure to fully charge the suits, but that was better than nothing. the bi question was, would we need it? 

If our scheme to get back home were to work, we wold need enough air to leave our craft and survive long enough to give the Behemoth new coordinate to go to. then, at least in our hopeful theory, we should be able to stick out our noses from the behemoth and get picked up by somebun. something like the Behemoth parking itself on Earth's low orbit would definitely stir a ton curiosity. As  long as nobun would try  to blast us out of there, we might have a chance. However, if we miss the golden window of opportunity and arrive before bunkind started space exploration or after they stopped it for some unfathomable reason ...

Well, I didn't wan tot think about that. Somehow, I still  had an appetite.  I called on Hopper and Mel to take a break and eat something.  As we nomed the last of fresh hay and dug into the 3-D printed meal biscuits, fatigue took the better of us. We either worked our tail off or were getting tired more easily. I welcomed it, maybe tonight would be restful. We sure cold use some good zee's.
