X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 25

Author's note:

I didn't realize at first that I ended the story. I just gazed outside thought one of the windows. Another orbital sunset got me before I knew it. Zoomer set on her couch, her nose slowly, steadily twitching up and down. Her feet were tucked into the sleeping pouch and held her in place. Looked at me without a word and wiggled herself into the sleeping pouch. I did the same. "So, Major, you think I should be able to sleep on that story now?" asked Zoomer quietly, gravely accepting of what she heard. She continued after a long pause, "You know, if I ever meet Pancake or Abby, or any of the others,  I'll be asking them about it." "I wouldn't expect anything else; good night," I said.

The next morning Zoomer woke up before me and was done with the morning chores before I opened my first eye. "Major, two hours and twelve minutes before the cutter probe arrives," announced Zoomer. "I suggest we suit up. From what I hear they are unreliable half the time, "added Zoomer. "Good idea," I yawned. 

I pulled up the latest weather forecast and pondered what else to throw at Zoomer. I grabbed a warm beverage and a high fiber chew bar and looked through our potential landing sites. Which site we would land on depended on when Zoomer would do the retro burn. Most of the sites were very unappealing, vanilla spots on the various oceans. There was one place that looked interesting. If we shallowed out our re-entry angle, we could splash down outside the bounds of the standard recovery zone corridor. Zoomer would get extra points for that. I looked at the clock and tried to do the math in my head to figure out when the retro burn would have to happen for us to hit that particular location. I typed in my request tot he center to verify my numbers. It turned out I was close enough.

Then Zoomer and I got ready for the cutter probe. The probe gripped our ship and the unruly booster and separated the two. Zoomer thought was her luckiest day ever and because the maneuver went without any of the horror stories she heard. I rechecked the clock and tightened my couch restraints a bit more, and started a three-minute countdown timer. Zoomer paid no attention to me and carried on with the Center and Capcom. She was so exuberant because she just about had the entire check flight in the bag. I opened the cover of my right keypad.

I entered the first malfunction code and pressed the exec key. All hay broke loose. "You're losing pressure, fuel cells one and three are offline," I announced calmly. The simulated emergency didn't bother me and thee' was no real trouble to deal with. What crossed my mind though, was apprehension about what that would trigger in Zoomer. Would she react like I did that one time when I refused to let my instructor take the controls? It happened. We had a good laugh about it, but deep down inside I thought no bun would ever fly with me ever again. She said, "I have the aircraft," and I was supposed to say "you have the aircraft," and so on. It was a proficiency training, and my instructor was putting me through the usual workout. She wanted to put the craft into an unusual attitude and have me recover from it. However, something snapped in me that time. Instead, I said, "No, why?" and we both burst out laughing. Of course, she got the aircraft, and we did the training routine, but deep down inside it bother me. I thought, "What if my student did that?" For a long time, I thought I was done for. I never took any bun's reaction for granted.

I watched what Zoomer would do. She didn't flinch. She declared the emergency and asked me to work the radios. Zoomer got on with configuring the craft for immediate deorbit. She threw a surprised look between the checklists and carried on. Zoomer looked at me with raised eyebrows again once she realized we would be landing at night. She dumped our service module to be recovered by a recycling crew and proceeded with the deorbit burn. We were heading home whether we liked it or not.

It just so happened that there was a shift change at the Center and a new Capcom came on. "Toes, you old trickster! What are you up to? Fancy a night swim in the ocean?" That was Hopper! "What are you doing there? I thought you would be on your berry farm?" I exclaimed. "I was on my way out the door, and then we heard what you did. You know night landings are no fun," giggled Hopper.

He was right. I kicked up a lot of commotion. I could just imagine the recovery crews scrambling. All youngsters still on student status were chomping at the bit for a chance to get a live rescue point and be that much closer to graduation. They had to be trained one way or another, like everybunny else, so why not give them something to do?
