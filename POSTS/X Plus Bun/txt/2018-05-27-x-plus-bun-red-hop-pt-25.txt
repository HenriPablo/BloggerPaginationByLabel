X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 25


Author's note:


I didn't realize at first that I ended the story. I just gazed outside thought one of the windows. Another orbital sunset got me before I knew it. Zoomer set on her couch, her nose slowly, steadily twitching up and down. Her feet were tucked into the sleeping pouch and held her in place. Looked at me without a word and wiggled herself into the sleeping pouch. I did the same. "So, Major, you think I should be able to sleep on that story now?" asked Zoomer quietly, gravely accepting of what she heard. She continued after a long pause, "You know, if I ever meet Pancake or Abby, or any of the others,  I'll be asking them about it." "I wouldn't expect anything else; good night," I said.

The next morning Zoomer woke up before me and was done with the morning chores before I opened my first eye. "Major, two hours and twelve minutes before the cutter probe arrives," announced Zoomer. "I suggest we suit up. From what I hear they are unreliable half the time, "added Zoomer. "Good idea," I yawned. 

I pulled up the latest weather forecast and pondered what else to throw at Zoomer. I grabbed a warm beverage and a high fiber chew bar and looked through our potential landing sites. Which site we would land on depended on when Zoomer would do the retro burn. Most of the sites were very unappealing, vanilla spots on the various oceans. There was one place that looked interesting. If we shallowed out our re-entry angle, we could splash down outside the bounds of the standard recovery zone corridor. Zoomer would get extra points for that. I looked at the clock and tried to do the math in my head to figure out when the retro burn would have to happen for us to hit that particular location. I typed in my request tot he center to verify my numbers. It turned out I was close enough.

Then Zoomer and I got ready for the cutter probe. The probe gripped our ship and the unruly booster and separated the two. Zoomer thought was her luckiest day ever and because the maneuver went without any of the horror stories she heard. I rechecked the clock and tightened my couch restraints a bit more, and started a three-minute countdown timer. Zoomer paid no attention to me and carried on with the Center and Capcom. She was so exuberant because she just about had the entire check flight in the bag. I opened the cover of my right keypad.
