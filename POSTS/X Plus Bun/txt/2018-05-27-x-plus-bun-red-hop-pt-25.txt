X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 25

Author's note:

I didn't realize at first that I ended the story. I just gazed outside thought one of the windows. Another orbital sunset got me before I knew it. Zoomer set on her couch with her feet were tucked into the sleeping pouch to stay in place. Her nose twitched up and down. She looked at me without a word and wiggled herself into the sleeping pouch. I did the same. "So, Major, you think I should be able to sleep on that story now?" asked Zoomer quietly, gravely accepting of what she heard. She continued after a long pause, "You know, if I ever meet Pancake or Abby, or any of the others,  I'll be asking them about it." "I wouldn't expect anything else; good night," I said.

The next morning Zoomer woke up before me and was done with the morning chores before I opened my first eye. "Major, two hours and twelve minutes before the cutter probe arrives," announced Zoomer. "I suggest we suit up. From what I hear they are unreliable half the time," added Zoomer. "Good idea," I yawned. 

I pulled up the latest weather forecast and pondered what else to throw at Zoomer. I grabbed a warm beverage and a high fiber chew bar and looked through our potential landing sites. The timing of Zoomer's retro burn would determine where we land. Most of the sites were very unappealing, vanilla spots on the various oceans. There was one place that looked interesting. If we shallowed out our re-entry angle, we could splash down outside the bounds of the standard recovery zone corridor. Zoomer would get extra points for that. I looked at the clock and tried to do the math in my head to figure out when the retro burn would have to happen for us to hit that particular location. I typed in my request to the center to verify my numbers. It turned out I was close enough.

Then Zoomer and I got ready for the cutter probe. The probe gripped our ship and the unruly booster and separated the two. Zoomer thought this was her luckiest day ever because the maneuver went without any of the horror stories she heard. I rechecked the clock, tightened my couch restraints, and started a three-minute countdown timer. Zoomer paid no attention to me and carried on with the Center and Capcom. She was so exuberant because she just about had the entire check flight in the bag. I opened the cover of my right keypad. I entered the first malfunction code and pressed the exec key. 

All hay broke loose. "You're losing pressure, fuel cells one and three are off-line," I announced calmly. As I increased the pressure on Zoomer, a funny thing crossed my mind. Would she react like I did that one time when I refused to let my instructor take the controls? The instructor and I had a good laugh about it, but deep down inside I thought no bun would fly with me ever again. She said "I have the aircraft" and I was supposed to say "You have the aircraft," and so on. It was a proficiency training flight, and my instructor was putting me through the usual workout. She wanted to put the craft into an unusual attitude and have me recover from it. But something snapped in me, and instead, I said, "No, why?" We both burst out laughing. Of course, she got the aircraft, and we did the training routine. Then I thought, "What if my student did that?" For a long time, I thought I was done for, and I never took any bun's reaction for granted.

I watched what Zoomer would do. She declared the emergency without a flinch and asked me to work the radios. She got on with configuring the craft for immediate deorbit. Somewhere between the checklists, Zoomer looked at me with raised eyebrows once she realized we would be landing at night. She dumped our service module to be recovered by a recycling crew and proceeded with the deorbit burn. We were heading home whether we liked it or not.

It just so happened that there was a shift change at the Center and a new Capcom came on. "Toes, you old trickster! What are you up to? Fancy a night swim in the ocean, do you?" That was Hopper! "What are you doing there? I thought you would be on your berry farm?" I exclaimed. "I was on my way out the door, and then we heard what you did. You know, night landings are no fun," giggled Hopper.

He was right. I kicked up a lot of commotion. I could just imagine the recovery crews scrambling. All the youngsters still on student status were chomping at the bit for a chance to get live rescue points and be that much closer to graduation. They had to be trained one way or another, like everybunny else, so why not give them something to do?

I was hoping Abby and Pancake would be listening in on the Center frequency. We usually try to eavesdrop on bun another when somebun is on orbit and the other on the ground. They were on a work vacation, tending to experiments with growing hydroponic carrots in seawater. 

I checked on Zoomer one more time. She was still all business but seemed a bit more relaxed. She knew she was doing well. "We have a low-pressure weather system approaching our landing site, a category four cyclone," I announced, "Rog, say present position and direction of movement," acknowledged Zoomer. "It's moving fast north, north-west and we are best to avoid it to the north," I responded.

"Good grief, Toes, she won't get any points for a heart attack, you know!" Hopper chimed in quite out of line, and continued, "Rog, Red Hop One, correct at your discretion." We needed to flatten out our trajectory just a tiny bit, half a whisker, to skip over the imagined bad weather. I felt a little jolt as Zoomer tilted the capsule just a fraction. The new trajectory would take us outside the normal recovery zone enough to qualify our landing as “off-site.” Once we stabilized, I said to Zoomer, “That's enough points for one flight." "Don't let me stop you if you need more points, Major," Zoomer cut right back.

Now there wouldn't be just ships speeding toward our landing site. At least one or two long-range SeaRex amphibian transport planes would be taking from the nearest bases.
