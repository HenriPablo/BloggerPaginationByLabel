X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 23

Author's note: Last week, Mr. Toes and his launched their craft into orbit in an attempt to return to when whey came from.

My hearing was first return. The ear is a simpler, mechanical, device compared to the eye, so we register sound faster than sight. Not that it made much difference. I couldn’t understand anything I was starting to hear. the ringing and humming of the background nose went away very slowly. Somebun was speaking, “Jahoppy One, Jahoppy One, do you read?” By the time I made sens of it, somebun else spoke, “Loud and clear, Jahoppy One.” Joey? Was it Joey? “Jahoppy One, state your emergency, how many souls on board?” that other voice asked. "We have six on board, four are unresponsive, we're still assessing, stand by, Jahoppy One." Penny? Was that our little Penny? "Toes here. I think I'm OK," I said. "Pancake here, I can't see yet." Abby, Molly and Ava checked in after a while too.

I started noticing some colors. They were blurry at first and pale. I wanted to rub my eyes with my paws, but couldn't. I still had my helmet on and those thick gloves. Of course, It could have been worse. My nose could have been inching. I blinked a lot and hoped that would clear my eyes. There was a lot grunting and cussing on the intercom as everybunny tried to come to grips with being alive.

I could finally see why all the colors I saw were so fuzzy and diluted. The visor was fogged up. That meant the life support system in my suit went out for a  while, but for how long? The first thing I realized was that the CO level was dropping now, out of the red zone and decreasing. For how long did it stay in the red? My visor display finally started responding to commands. I wanted to check the ship's life support system. We still had a pressurized ship! "Abby? Abby!" I called out, "... do you think we're got enough pressure to take off the the suits?"
"I don't know, I'm still seeing fuzzy," came back Abby. "I think we're OK," offered Pancake. Then, Molly added, "I'm staying put ofr now. It looks like we have lost pressure at some point, that's why it's coming back up. This poor thing is trying to heal itself. We have to run a full propulsion test." Joey was the most coherent of us and did most the talking to the Center. We could pick whatever space way we wanted to whatever hub could suit us the most.

Now my stomach was letting me know how unhappy it felt. I was mad about not being able to throw up. Then I was glad that I couldn't because I would probably drown in my own puke, right in my helmet. so I relaxed as much as I could and watched the different diagnostic checks my visor was displaying. Everything was coming back in green.

Something started to load right in front of my left eye. I got spooked a little, but it turned out to be just a lady bug. She inside my helmet. probably got lost or stuck there during our picnic. She, was it she? A little clump of bright, orange hair was stuck to one of her legs. I didn't see her move her legs or anything, I though she didn't make it. But when she hit the surface of my bubble, she came to life and gripped slick, glassy surface of the visor and marched out of sight. She took the orange hair with her. Maybe she was the tiny, so tiny, bit of good luck we needed to sway fate our way?
