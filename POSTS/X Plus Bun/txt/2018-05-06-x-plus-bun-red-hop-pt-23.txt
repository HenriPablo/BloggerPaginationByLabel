X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 23

Author's note: Last week, Mr. Toes and his launched their craft into orbit in an attempt to return to when whey came from.

My hearing was first return. The ear is a simpler, mechanical, device compared to the eye, so we register sound faster than sight. Not that it made much difference. I couldn’t understand anything I was starting to hear. the ringing and humming of the background nose went away very slowly. Somebun was speaking, “Jahoppy One, Jahoppy One, do you read?” By the time I made sens of it, somebun else spoke, “Loud and clear, Jahoppy One.” Joey? Was it Joey? “Jahoppy One, state your emergency, how many souls on board?” that other voice asked.
