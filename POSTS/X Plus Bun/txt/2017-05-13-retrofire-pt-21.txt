X-Plus Bun - Retrofire, Pt. 21
I spent the next couple of days snooping about the station, trying to find out the best way to disable it. A strange thing took place. Time seemed to melt away as I dove deeper and deeper into the station's systems. I would forget to eat or drink, and I hardly moved from my spot. Every time the orderlies came by for their rudimentary visits, they almost startled me to death. The sound of opening doors violently jarred me to the surface from the depth of almost alternate reality. I was learning more about the station than I thought was possible.

I discovered that I could trigger a shutdown of the weight balancing system of the pseudo-gravity mechanism the hospital used. To make things more interesting, if the sysadmins tried to stop the rotation of the entire system, they would only accelerate it more. The immediate shutdown of all systems would be their only option. To foil my little mischief, they would have to act immediately, without any delay. I didn't have much going for me. I could only hope the sysadmins would have the good old "it never did THAT before" stupefied reaction to the developing disaster. Yes, the plan was risky, and a bit far fetched, but how could it not be?   What worried me wasn't the plan, but the funny feeling I had in my gut.  It was my incessant exploration of the station's systems  and the pace at which I was moving through them that gave me pause. It frazzled me whenever I stopped to think about it during my forced noming breaks. It would be one thing if I were involved in the design of the labyrinth I was exploring or if such designs were my specialty or a point of interest, but as far as I could attest, none of those conditions applied to me.


On the one paw, it led me to wonder again who I think I was, on the other paw, I was glad for it because it would let me bust out of here that much quicker. The question still hung over me though, where exactly would I go after the breakout? Keep in mind, at that time I had no idea that two vessels were converging on St. Cinnamon.

I don't know at exactly what time I run out of energy to dig into the station's systems any deeper. I was way past what I needed to know to do the job. I didn't  so much go to sleep but rather passed out. I didn't check on Hopper or Mel. For some reason, I wasn't  worried about them anymore.

The sound of the doors sliding open for the orderlies bringing breakfast salad and paying their respects on behalf of the big brother woke me up. I sat up straight, even though my body screamed for twice as much sleep time as I had gotten that night. When you're not up for their visit, they think your temperature will tell them something about why you're not up. So they proceed to check your temperature. I don't like it. No, they don't check your temperature like THAT; not anymore. They take pictures of you and strap gizmos to you. I don't  like my pictures taken, and I don't like their gizmos. So it's easier just to sit up.

I had served my usual sideways stink eye and the harshest frown I could muster to both of the orderlies and enjoyed some salad. They were used to that and cleared out as soon as they could. I went back to sleep. Next time I got up, I finished the leftover salad and went to work.

I didn't have to turn off completely the weight balancer. I only had to slow it down by tricking it into thinking it had a lot less weight to balance. As the balancer slowed down, the system reacted to the anomaly by trying to speed up the balancer. Well, the system sent the right command, but the component responsible for its execution didn't work anymore they way it was supposed to. It slowed down the balancer even more.

That day, whoever worked the shift in the control room, tried to fix the problem manually. Again, he or she did the right thing, as the manual instructed them and attempted to speed up the balancer.  Now the balancer continued to slow down until it stopped.

Of course, no bun has seen such a combination of failures, and while they tried to figure out what had happened, the system tried to recover. Since it couldn't  make heads or tails out of the puzzle either,  it opted for the easy way out by initiating a shutdown of the station.

Since the part of the hospital equipped with the now broken centrifugal gravity system threatened to break up the rest of the structure, the system sounded an evacuation alarm and started shutting down and isolating parts of the hospital one by one. Going into full emergency mode meant getting help from the outside world as soon as possible. The hospital broke its radio silence.

I left my pod as the mayhem started to froth and went looking for Hopper. He was waiting for me.
"You know, Major; when it rains it pours, I bet you, the ventilation system is about to have a very bad day," said Hopper as he winked at me. I was not surprised.

The two of us went on to look for Mel. He greeted us with a smile.
"Gents, the airlocks are about to go." growled Mel.

Hopper and I grunted and nodded in approval as we kept on moving toward the shuttle deck.
