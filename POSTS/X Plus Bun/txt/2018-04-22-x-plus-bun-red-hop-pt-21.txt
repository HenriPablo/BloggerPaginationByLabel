X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 21

We stayed out late and the later it got, the less we wanted to end the picnic. A thick current of apprehension built up through the night. We didn’t want to face having to go back “home,” whatever that meant anymore. Anxiety started permeating us like the surrounding cold, damp night. After our big art discussion, Joey sunk into a puddle of melancholy. He kept trying to talk to “Hop” but Hopmeric never answered.

Finally, Pancake and Penny took the electric cart and went back to the ship to get the disinfecting supplies. That moment was coming. We would have to part our ways with Hopmeric. When Pancake returned, she gave him a thorough scrub. She sniffed his leg where the wound used to be, but it was all healed. She said the leg felt absolutely fine to touch.

“Hop, do you want to go with us?” Joey tried one last time to get through. But there was no answer, Hopmeric sat and looked at us, a little discombobulated after the scrub and kept washing his mouf with his paws.

We had to go. We put everything back on the cart and the hover-stand, we took our seats for the short ride back to the ship. Joey tried to take “Hop” by the paw and lead him to the cart, but Hopmeric twisted away with a thump and hopped off into the night. I was sick to my stomach; my head was swirling. Joey kept staring at the dark woods and kept thumping. Pancake and I had to take him under his arms, lead him to the cart and placed him on the seat. He could barely move his feet. Joey slumped into the seat next to Molly and his head hung the lowest I have ever seen it. Our caravan moved slowly toward the ship. We made any funeral procession look like a circus.

When we arrived in the loading bay, the sound of the ramp closing with a heavy thud crushed my heart again. All of my defenses went down, and I felt incredibly exhausted and broken down. Abby and I went with Joey, and we all piled into his sleeping quarter. It was tight with all three of us there, but we would never live him alone on a night like that. I stretched cross bun style over his head and rested my chin on Abby’s back. I needed Joey and Abby as much as Joey needed us. I dropped off into slumber right away.

Waking up from that nap, was a rather unpleasant affair. I was still tired, but I couldn’t sleep anymore. So was everybun else. Pancake and Abby were both barking out the morning checklists for us. Joey and I had to start bringing the ship back to life and get it ready for launch. Pancake displayed a countdown time to liftoff on every idle monitor. The girls went back to the engine room to give it a good cleaning. All the microscopic debris after their work had to be removed. Airborne metal shavings in zero gravity would become a life hazard. They could get into small places and close electrical circuits, interfere with sensors, set off alarms and cause all sorts of cryptic and potentially deadly failures. Right now, the engine room was the most contaminated space on the ship and had to get the most attention. 

Once on the flight deck, I looked at Joey and got the feeling I would have to do everything myself. I helped him into his couch, handed him a sweet berry chew bar and a pouch of warm coffea beverage. I would rather he did nothing than screw up and get us all killed. This poor guy looked done for. If I had to do everything myself and we miss our window, we miss our window and so be it. We would take the next one. 

I settled into the familiar, old routine and worked through the checklist, hopping between the consoles when I had to switch between the systems. It made everything go slower, but I wanted to isolate the work on different systems in some physical way. I didn’t want to confuse the systems by working on a single screen. After a couple of hours, Joey started to “come back online” and at least followed me and provided a second pair of eyes on everything I did. We didn’t say a word about last night. There would be plenty of time for that later, should we be so lucky.

When Pancake and the others came up to the flight deck to check on us and to get something substantial to eat we decided to lunch during the next window. The engine room was still a mess, and we were all exhausted. There was no need to rush anything, and we opted for naps, right there at our stations. Only Joey stayed up, in the first row, next to the windows and stared quietly at the woods.
