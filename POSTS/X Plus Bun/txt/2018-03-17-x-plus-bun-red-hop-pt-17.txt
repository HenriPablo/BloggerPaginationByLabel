X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 17

I woke up shivering in the middle of the night and wondered what had happened. Hopmeric was on the couch next to me, covered up with a blankie. I guess somebun took pity on him. He kept gritting his teeth, and his mouf kept twitching. I went to the litter bin and then tried to find something to cover up with. Before crawling back into my couch I saw a note in Abby's paw writing, "You're patching the skin first thing in the morning!" I crumpled the note and tossed it. I just hoped my head would spare me when the sun came up.

In the late morning, I got Joey to help me work on the skid. We collected all the cadmium chronochromium dioxide into a pale and cleaned out the 'wound' in the skid. That's when we got a proper look at the extent of the damage. 


The most outer layer of the protective armor  was scrapped off. That made sense, since it was a fairly light substance, designed to dissipate hear and not protect again the armor vaporizing forces of impact with foreign object at orbital velocities. The next layer, designed for just such accidents was gouged out and caved in. You could see in the bottom of it a series of thin cracks in the material. It looked like the bottom of a dry lake, parched and baked to death by the sun. Behind the damaged layer, the secondary  heat isolator crumbled and exploded. thus the well housing the retracted skid was left, essentially, unprotected. And behind that, the rest of of the ship, open for the melting. I gulped. I've seen damage done by impact of nuggets of iron and nickle, but nothing like this. 



All seemed to be intact, but we had to fill the breach in the bottom of the skid. Joey tilted his head and furrowed his brows. Before he could say anything, I blurted out, "We don't have enough material to patch it, do we?" "Nope, Major, we don't" growled Joey. "Check the numbers to be sure, would you?" I asked him, but Joey was already on it. In my earpiece, I heard the noises coming from the engine room. A high pitched drill or a saw. Somebun was banging something with a hammer. I think I heard two hammers, devastating something in a brutal rhythm of two buns taking turns and swinging the heavy iron on a stick.

"Stop! Everybunny stop! Right now ..." I screamed into the intercom. Things got quiet, and Abby came on, "It better good, Toes." I looked at Joey, and he shook his head in silence, "We don't have enough patch material to repair the skid for re-entry." "What do you mean?" Abby responded. She had to know where I was going with this, but she was stalling form some reason. "Well, you know,..." I started slowly and went on, "we won't be able to re-enter with such a light application of this stuff. It will ablate, and the gear will melt, you know the rest." The silence continued and so did I after a moment, "What I mean is, whatever you're doing to the reactor, you better be sure of it, because we won't be able to come back here if it doesn't work. We need a proper dry-dock to fix this up to spec. We only get one trip to orbit with this thing."

After a second or two I heard the distinct change in the audio tone in my earpiece telling me that Abby put me on mute. She muted me! She came back after a moment said, "Rog!," and all the banging and sawing, and drilling resumed.

Hopmeric sat on the ground and watched Joey and me. From time to time he would go inside the ship after Pancake or Abby, then he would hope out and watch us again. He went on like that the entire day.

We would have to settle for a light application of the structural repair solution to the wound. I raised the hover-stand even higher and closer to the gash in the skid, and started placing the small, flat, repair pods on the surface of the wound. The looked a little bit like sand dollar shaped electrodes, with metal clad feeder lines for delivery of the raw repair compound. When I had them all in place, Joey had to throw a switch that would release the patch material stored in a high pressure container through the feed line into the electrodes. There, the fine powder would get activated and crawl all over the wound, grow and spread on the surface like algea before finally heating up and bonding with the armor.

The trouble was, we didn't have enough of this power to treat such  a large area. We would need several coats of it to do the job right, but only had enough for one. I waited for Joey to throw the switch on the applicator pump, "Joey? Ready when you are." I finally looked at Joey. He was looking down at Hopmeric sitting on the ground, looking back at us. "Hey, Joey, what's going on?" I asked as I tapped him on the shoulder. He looked at me for a second and turned his attention back to Hopmeric. "Maybe we can let him throw the switch? Wanna bring him up here? I wonder if the bipeds are watching us, you know," mused Joey. "Come on, Joey, just throw the damn switch, you can play with him later. If we bring him here, he'll have a heart attack. you can show him how to enjoy a catnip stogie later, OK?" Joey grinned and threw the switch, "Guess you're right, Major." 

By night time we finished all the repair chores. The next day we would complete the modifications of the reactor, and try to leave this place. Once the loading ramp came up, this would be it.

We build a fire that night, right under the nose of the ship and we had a feast. Hopmeric sensed our time together was coming to a close but showed no inclination to follow us into the unknown. Before we went inside for the last time, Pancake looked over his wounded hock. It appeared the treatment worked and there was no sign of pus. We all noticed he started doing strange things with his paws. He was starting to grip. Will he mind the price he was going to pay for getting this, otherwise lethal, wound healed? Pancake scrubbed him one more time to make sure he wouldn't carry back any germs his kin couldn't cope with. He looked at us, thumped, turned around and run for the woods. We put out the fire and headed inside. No bun said a word. I felt like crying.
