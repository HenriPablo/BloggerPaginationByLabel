X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 17

I woke up shivering in the middle of the night and wondered what had happened. Hopmeric was on the couch next to me, covered up with a blankie. I guess somebun took pity on him. He kept gritting his teeth, and his mouf kept twitching. I went to the litter bin and then tried to find something to cover up with. Before crawling back into my couch I saw a note in Abby's paw writing, 'You're patching the skin first thing in the morning!' I crumpled the note and tossed it. I just hoped my head would not try to kill me too badly when the sun comes up.

In the late morning, I got Joey to help me work on the skid. We collected all the cadmium chronochromium dioxide into a pale and cleaned out the 'wound' in the skid. That's when we got a proper look at the extent of the damage. All seemed to be intact, but we had to fill the breach in the bottom of the skid. Joey tilted his head and furrowed his brows. Before he could say anything, I blurted out, 'We don't have enough material to patch it, do we?' 'Nope, Major, we don't' growled Joey. 'Check the numbers to be sure, would you?' I asked Joey, but he was already on it. In my earpiece, I heard the noises coming from the engine room. A high pitched drill or a saw. Somebun was banging something with a hammer. I think I heard two hammers, devastating something in a brutal rhythm of two buns taking turns to swing the heavy iron on a stick.

'Stop! Everybunny stop! Right now ...' I screamed into the intercom. Things got quiet, and Abby came on, 'It better good, Toes.' I looked at Joey, and he shook his head in silence, 'We don't have enough patch material to repair the skid for re-entry.'  'What do you mean?' Abby responded. I knew the news sunk in right away, and she was stalling form some reason. Not that I minded, but it wouldn't get us any more material. 'Well, you know,...' I started slowly and went on, 'we won't be able to re-enter with such a light application of this stuff. It will ablate, and the gear will melt, you know the rest.' The silence continued and so did I after a moment, 'What I mean is, whatever you're doing to the reactor, you better be sure of it, because we won't be able to come back here if it doesn't work. We will need a proper dry-dock to fix this up to spec. We only get one trip to orbit with this thing.'

After a second or two I heard the distinct change in the audio tone in my earpiece telling me that Abby put me on mute. She muted me! She came back after a moment said, 'Rod,' and all the banging and sawing, and drilling resumed.

Hopmeric sat on the ground and watched Joey and me. From time to time he would go inside the ship after Pancake or Abby, then he would hope out and watch us again. He went on like that the entire day.

By night time we finished all the repair chores. The next day we would complete the modifications of the reactor, and try to leave this place. Once the loading ramp came up, this would be it.

We build a fire that night, right under the nose of the ship and we had a feast. Hopmeric sensed our time together was coming to a close but showed no inclination to follow us into the unknown. Before we went inside for the last time, Pancake looked over his wounded hock. There was no sign of pus. It appeared the treatment worked. We all noticed he started doing strange things with his paws. He was starting to grip. Will he mind the price he was going to pay for getting his, otherwise lethal, wound healed? Pancake scrubbed him one more time to make sure he wouldn't carry back any germs his kin couldn't cope with. He looked at us one more time, thumped, turned around and run into the woods. We put out the fire and headed inside. No bun said a word. I felt like crying."
