X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 18

"Once the applicators started activating the repair compound, we had to back away from the skid. The amound of heat released from the spreading sealant was enormous. you could roast a carrot  in it. you would burn it mostly likely, so don't try it. You would rubn off all your whiskers too."

"How come I've not heard of that stuff?" Zoomer interrupted me.
"It's old stuff, they don't us it anymore. We had rented junker for that trip, remember? Look into that if you don't believe me," I responded. Zoomer squinted here eyes a little. I couldn't really see eyes, but I knew where they were, and I did see her brows twitch just enough. Her hair was sticking straight out in every direction and here main became light up by  a streak of itht that blasted its way inside the capsule from another orbital sunrise. I picked up the story again. 

So, Joey and I set the hover-stand on the ground and we started the cleanup after the repairs. Even down on the ground we could smell the metallic, burn air coming off the healing skid. Hopmeric disappeared somewhere since las saw him and Joye got a little frantic about it. I had to keep pulling him back to the task at paw. then we saw him. Hopmeric sat next to Molly on a small utility cart. She came straight at us and made a hard turn avoid us, kicking up dirt and dust while breaking.
