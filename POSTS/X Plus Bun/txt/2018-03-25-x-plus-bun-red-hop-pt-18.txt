X-Plus Bun: Red Hop, Pt. 18

"Once the applicators started activating the repair compound, we had to back away from the skid. The amound of heat released from the spreading sealant was enormous. you could roast a carrot  in it. you would burn it mostly likely, so don't try it. You would rubn off all your whiskers too."

"How come I've not heard of that stuff?" Zoomer interrupted me.
"It's old stuff, they don't us it anymore. We had rented junker for that trip, remember? Look into that if you don't believe me," I responded. Zoomer squinted here eyes a little. I couldn't really see eyes, but I knew where they were, and I did see her brows twitch just enough. Her hair was sticking straight out in every direction and here main became light up by  a streak of itht that blasted its way inside the capsule from another orbital sunrise. I picked up the story again. 

So, Joey and I set the hover-stand on the ground and we started the cleanup after the repairs. Even down on the ground we could smell the metallic, burn air coming off the healing skid. Hopmeric disappeared somewhere since las saw him and Joye got a little frantic about it. I had to keep pulling him back to the task at paw. then we saw him. Hopmeric sat next to Molly on a small utility cart. She came straight at us and made a hard turn avoid us, kicking up dirt and dust while breaking. The back of the cart was loaded with debrie and scrap. Whatever they had to saw off best had to be thrown out. There was no sense lugging the dead weight to orbit. We helped her unloading it. 
"Abby wants to bury it in a shallow pit under one of the engines. We;ll vaporize all the trash during the lunch," said Molly and drove away back into the ship

Hopmeric stayed with us. I got everybunny clear of the skid and released the applicators. They fell and hit the ground with a thud like a bunch of slain, monstrous serpents. I wondered for  a while if we had to stow them away but, we decided to leave them with the rubbish. 
"Hey, Hop, you wanna give us a paw here?" chuckled Joey. But Hopmeric didn't move, just kept observing us quietly. I had a feeling his gaze was becoming more penetrating. He was rubbing his paws a lot and looking at them. He wold wiggle his toes and look at them as if he was seeing them for the first time. He would turn his paw every which way and stare at it then look at me quizzically before going back to his paw.

It was getting dusky when we finished and I was starving. Joey and I sat down on the hover-stand and we pulled out some snacks. Hopmeric followed us like a shadow of course and we shared a few bits with him. Joey passed around a thermos with a chamomile and mint tea and it tasted so refreshing. Even Hopmeric enjoyed it, apprehensive at first about anything coming out a thermos. But this time it tasted good and he drank most of the tea. 
"That's right, Hop. That's the proper good stuff!" Joey quipped and carried on, "This is gonna make your tummy feel good and won't do anything to your head." He ribbed me after that. Joey moved closer to Hopmeric and scratched him behind the ears.
