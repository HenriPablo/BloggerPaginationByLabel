Star Bun: The Next of Kin


The Elder Bun held a bag, and everybun from the crew of fire hopped by slowly and dropped into it a paw full of their own pellets.

The last time we had done this was when the experimental freighter Hopper-Alpha-1 lost one of its engineers during an emergency EBA. Zeph would then take the bag, draw a pellet from it, and test it to see who its creator was.

Of course, we would all participate in the ceremony, but we had to have somebun do the initial talking to the next of kin. We were all in it together when we lost one of our crew. We always knew we could lose anybun at any time, no matter what his or her rank, or who the commanding bun was. We just wanted to be fair when picking the spokes bun. Fate didn't care about the rank of the bun, who commanded him or her and neither did their family.

Flopfoot’s personal items, a fragment of a zipper from his suit, bloodstained and charred, a piece from his helmet’s external visor.

Zeph looked up from his DNA mapper and fixed his gaze on Joey. The Elder Bunstronaut became quiet and gritted his teeth in sadness. He remained still for a long time, lost in the memories of flights past before he broke the silence again, “Tough pick, Joey.”
