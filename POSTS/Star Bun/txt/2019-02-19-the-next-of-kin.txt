Star Bun: The Next of Kin

The Elder Bunstronaut held a bag, and everybun from our crew of five slowly hopped by and dropped a paw full of their own pellets into the bag. Zeph would reach into the bag, draw a pellet and run a test to match it to its creator.

The last time we had done this was when the experimental trash sweeper Hopper-Alpha-1 lost one of its flight engineers during an emergency EBA.

Of course, we would all visit young Sharpfoot’s Mom, but we had to have somebun to be the first bun to speak. We were all in it together when we lost one of our crew. We always knew we could lose anybun at any time, and Fate didn't care about the rank of the bun or who commanded him or her. We just wanted to be fair when picking the spokes bun.

Sharpfoot’s personal items, a fragment of a sleeve from his suit, bloodstained and charred; a piece of his helmet’s external visor, all rested in a basket next to a potted seedling of a Willow tree.

Zeph looked up from his DNA mapper and fixed his gaze on Joey. The Elder Bunstronaut became quiet as he emptied the bag around the seedling and gritted his teeth in sadness. Scars, spots of worn out fun on his ears bore witness to the adventures long forgotten. One could be forgiven for thinking he was spending his day in the garden, napping and taking in the summer breeze. His eyes cut through that notion. Sharp and brilliant, resurrected by the tender paws of doctors, the eyes craved more start light.

He remained still for a long time, communing with  memories of friends and flights past then whispered, “Tough pick, Joey.”
