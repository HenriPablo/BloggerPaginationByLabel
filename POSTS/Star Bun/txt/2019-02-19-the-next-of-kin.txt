Star Bun: The Next of Kin

The Elder Bunstronaut held a bag, and all five of us left from the crew slowly hopped by and dropped a paw full of our pellets into it. Zeph would reach into the bag, draw a pellet, and run a test to match it to its creator.

The last time we had done this was when the experimental trash sweeper Hopper-Alpha-1 lost one of its flight engineers during an emergency EBA.

Of course, we would all visit young Sharpfoot's mom, but we had to have a spokesbun. We always knew Fate could take anybun of us, and she didn't care about the rank of the bun or who commanded him or her. We just wanted to be fair when picking the spokesbun.

- ORIGINAL:
Sharpfoot's personal items—a fragment of a sleeve from his suit, bloodstained and charred, and a piece of his helmet's external visor—all rested in a basket next to a potted seedling of a willow tree.

- REVISED

Zeph looked up from his DNA mapper and fixed his gaze on Joey. The Elder Bunstronaut became quiet as he emptied the bag around the seedling and gritted his teeth in sadness. Scars and spots of worn-out fur on his ears bore witness to the adventures long forgotten. One could be forgiven for thinking he was spending his days in the garden, napping and taking in the summer breeze. His eyes cut through that notion. Sharp and brilliant, resurrected by the tender paws of doctors, the eyes craved more starlight.

He remained still for a long time, communing with memories of friends and flights past, then whispered, "Tough pick, Joey."
