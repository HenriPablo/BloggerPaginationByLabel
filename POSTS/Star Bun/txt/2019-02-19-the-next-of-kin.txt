Star Bun: The Next of Kin

The Elder Bun held a bag, and everybun from our crew of five hopped by slowly and dropped into it a paw full of their own pellets. Zeph would then draw a pellet from the bag, and run a test to match the pellet to its creator.

The last time we had done this was when the experimental freighter Hopper-Alpha-1 lost one of its engineers during an emergency EBA.

Of course, we would all visit young Flopfoot’s Mom, but we had to have somebun to the first bun to speak. We were all in it together when we lost one of our crew. We always knew we could lose anybun at any time, and Fate didn't care about the rank of the bun or who commanded him or her. We just wanted to be fair when picking the spokes bun.

Flopfoot’s personal items, a fragment of a sleeve from his suit, bloodstained and charred; a piece of his helmet’s external visor, rested in a basket next to a potted seedling of a Willow tree.

Zeph looked up from his DNA mapper and fixed his gaze on Joey. The Elder Bunstronaut became quiet as he emptied the bag around the seedling and gritted his teeth in sadness. He remained still for a long time, communing with  memories of friends and flights past before shipering, “Tough pick, Joey.”
