Star Bun: The Next of Kin


The last time we had to do this, we deposited our pellets into a bag. Zeph would then draw one of them and test it to see who its creator was. Of course, we would all participate in the ceremony, but we had to have somebun do the initial talking to the next of kin. We were all in it together when we lost one our crew, and we always knew we could lose anybun at any time, regardless of who the commanding bun was, so we just wanted to be fair when we talked to the family. Fate didn't care about the rand of the, but it took and neither did his or her family.

The elder bunstronaut became quiet and gritted his teeth in sadness. He remained still for a long time, lost in the memories of flights past before he broke the silence again, "That's how we did it back then."
