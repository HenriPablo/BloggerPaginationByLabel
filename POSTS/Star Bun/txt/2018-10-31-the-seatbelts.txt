Star Bun: Seat belts

I almost missed the last sliver of the sun before it disappeared beyond the horizon made up by a smooth, thick cloud layer. The cloud deck below us started to turn gray and cold.

Up front, the Young Bun in the commander’s seat called for the initial approach checklist. The Younger Bun, sitting to his right in the pilot seat, started going through the checklist calling out one item after the other. The Young Bun confirmed each item at they flipped switches, turned knobs and brought up different projections on the windshield. Finally, the Young Bun announced taking manual control of the ship. I activated my controls, just in case. I sat behind the younger Bun and Joey was to my left, sitting behind the Young Bun. Joey activated his control stick as well and tested it. Now we were all participating in the upcoming landing. IN case of an emergency, any bun of us could fly the ship.

The Young Bun had to go manual. He wanted to get qualified as a commander, and he had to busy day working hard with very little help from all those automated systems the ship had to offer. But he didn’t mind. He picked the Younger Bun, already a freshly qualified commander, as his teammate. As to Joey and me, they didn’t have much to say. I was there to administer the exam and Joey was my backup and part of the consortium that would have to sign off on the exam. I think Joey just wanted to get out and do something, and a random training flight was fine with him. Especially when he didn’t have much to do. But when the commander-in-the-making started to fly by paw, Joey perked up quickly and stopped gazing after the sunset.

The Young Bun was very sharp and calm, keeping on top of the situation. The Younger Bun followed the orders mechanically, throwing the switches and turning the instruments out of boredom.

The Young Bun called for the landing gear extension. The Younger Bun replied and activated the gear. My bum picked up the momentary vibrations of the ship. To an outsider we looked like a giant, four-legged bug with a small body and long spindly legs with big, crow feet. As we sunk into the cloud cover, the ship picked up a little turbulence. The Young Bun straightened up a little more in his seat.

I moved my paw over the keypad and entered a couple of commands. Two red warning lights lit up on the consoled in front of the Buns. The Younger Bun called out the overheating booster pump on the starboard aft engine. They Young Bun confirmed it. Brief conversation ensued between them. The Younger Bun announced that this was an instrumentation problem - most likely. There were no secondary signs of a real problem. The propulsion system didn’t sens any issues like a loss of power on the affected engine or any change in pressure in the fuel system.

They Young Bun and the younger Bun were too sharp for tricks like that. I knew that before I threw them the “surprise.” The Young Bun turned his head toward me so ever slightly and I thought he smiled. As the Younger Bun worked to clean up after the emergency, Joey glanced at me puzzled, is if askking “You didn’t think that would trip them up, did you?” No, I didn’t expect something like that to unnerve them. All that was left for the Younger Bun to do was to cycle the warning light to turn it off. He was a little shorter fellow and at first he couldn’t reach the light. That was one of the less flattering aspects of this ship’s design. The part of the console where the light was located was hard to reach and you really had to work at it.
“Two thousand feet!” called out the Young Bun.

Frustrated, the Younger Bun hit the release button on his restraint system. He leaned forward and punched the annoying light. Exasperated, the Younger Bun notified the Flight Center of the incident, declared it a false alarm and turned his attention to the landing.

“Fife hundred!” called out the Young Bun without taking his eyes off the course projection. We were feeling more turbulence now. Both Buns concentrated on flying. The weather proved to be as bas they forecast predicted it, but seeing it and getting tossed around by it had a different feel than mere reading about it. You couldn’t see anything outside. We were in the middle of a blizzard and it was getting very dark. The Younger Bun confimred the landing site and almost complete lack of visibility.  We all concentrated on the touchdown. Even though we were landing in the Protected Zone, it was still a bush landing.

Once the first landing gear made contact with the ground, we had to have patience to let the others find their way to the Terra Firma. After a moment, all motion stopped and the Young Bun shut down the engines.

We had landed on a side of a hill and the only way we could tell that, was from the position of the landing grears. Outside, swirling snow drowned everything and our exterior lights were useless. Up front, both Buns were busy securint the ship. Once they finished, they high-fived bun another. "Did we nail it or what?" exlaimed the Young Bun. 
"Nice landing, thats ome nasty stuff outside," said Joey. Joey looked at me puzzled, wondering why I kept mum. 

"When's that snow storm going to be over, an hour, two? I'll take a nap till then. Let's go outside later," I said to no bun in particular and headed for my bunk. I wanted to stretch. I drunk some water and let Abby know we were on the ground. I was trying to figure out how Joey missed everything. Was the really slacking off like that? It didn't matter for now. I grabbed the paw rails and climbed into my little cabin. I stretched as much as I could and then dimmed the lights. I tuned the intercom to pick up the outside sounds.The wind howled unabated. From time to time I could hear the sound of the communication sensors deploying with clicks and clanks, and the shirr of the electric motors. After a while, the "civilized" noises stopped and only the wind remained.
