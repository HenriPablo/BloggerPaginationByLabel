Star Bun: Seatbelts

I almost missed the last sliver of the sun before it disappeared beyond the horizon made up by a smooth, thick cloud layer. The cloud deck below us started to turn gray and cold.

Up front, the Young Bun in the commander’s seat called for the initial approach checklist. The Younger Bun, sitting to his right in the pilot seat, started going through the checklist calling out one item after the other. The Young Bun confirmed each item at they flipped switches, turned knobs and brought up different projections on the windshield. Finally, the Young Bun announced taking manual control of the ship. I activated my controls, just in case. I sat behind the younger Bun and Joey was to my left, sitting behind the Young Bun. Joey activated his control stick as well and tested it. Now we were all participating in the upcoming landing. IN case of an emergency, any bun of us could fly the ship.

The Young Bun had to go manual. He wanted to get qualified as a commander, and he had to busy day working hard with very little help from all those automated systems the ship had to offer. But he didn’t mind. He picked the Younger Bun, already a freshly qualified commander, as his teammate. As to Joey and me, they didn’t have much to say. I was there to administer the exam and Joey was my backup and part of the consortium that would have to sign off on the exam. I think Joey just wanted to get out and do something, and a random training flight was fine with him. Especially when he didn’t have much to do. But when the commander-in-the-making started to fly by paw, Joey perked up quickly and stopped gazing after the sunset.

The Young Bun was very sharp and calm, keeping on top of the situation. The Younger Bun followed the orders mechanically, throwing the switches and turning the instruments out of boredom.

The Young Bun called for the landing gear extension. The Younger Bun replied and activated the gear. My bum picked up the momentary vibrations of the ship. To an outsider, we looked like a giant, four-legged bug with a small body and long spindly legs with big, crow feet. As we sunk into the cloud cover, the ship picked up a little turbulence. The Young Bun straightened up a little more in his seat.

I moved my paw over the keypad and entered a couple of commands. Two red warning lights lit up on the consoled in front of the Buns. The Younger Bun called out the overheating booster pump on the starboard aft engine. They Young Bun confirmed it. A brief conversation ensued between them. The Younger Bun announced that this was an instrumentation problem - most likely. There were no secondary signs of a real problem. The propulsion system didn’t sens any issues like a loss of power on the affected engine or any change in pressure in the fuel system.

They Young Bun and the younger Bun were too sharp for tricks like that. I knew that before I threw them the “surprise.” The Young Bun turned his head toward me so ever slightly, and I thought he smiled. As the Younger Bun worked to clean up after the emergency, Joey glanced at me puzzled, as if asking “You didn’t think that would trip them up, did you?” No, I didn’t expect something like that to unnerve them. All that was left for the Younger Bun to do was to cycle the warning light to turn it off. He was a little shorter fellow, and at first, he couldn’t reach the light. That was one of the less flattering aspects of this ship’s design. The part of the console where the light was located was hard to reach, and you really had to work at it.
“Two thousand feet!” called out the Young Bun.

Frustrated, the Younger Bun hit the release button on his restraint system. He leaned forward and punched the annoying light. Exasperated, the Younger Bun notified the Flight Center of the incident, declared it a false alarm and turned his attention to the landing.

“Five hundred!” called out the Young Bun without taking his eyes off the course projection. We were feeling more turbulence now. Both Buns concentrated on flying. The weather proved to be as bad they forecast predicted it, but seeing it and getting tossed around by it had a different feel than mere reading about it. You couldn’t see anything outside. We were in the middle of a blizzard, and it was getting very dark. The Younger Bun confirmed the landing site and almost complete lack of visibility.  We all concentrated on the touchdown. Even though we were landing in the Protected Zone, it was still a bush landing.

Once the first landing gear made contact with the ground, we had to have the patience to let the others find their way to the Terra Firma. After a moment, all motion stopped and the Young Bun shut down the engines.

We had landed on the side of a hill, and the only way we could tell that was from the position of the landing gears. Outside, swirling snow drowned everything, and our exterior lights were useless. Up front, both Buns were busy securing the ship. Once they finished, they high-fived bun another. "Did we nail it or what?" exclaimed the Young Bun. 
"Nice landing, that's some nasty stuff outside," said Joey. Joey looked at me puzzled, wondering why I kept mum. 

"When's that snow storm going to be over, an hour, two? I'll take a nap till then. Let's go outside later," I said to no bun in particular and headed for my bunk. I wanted to stretch. I drunk some water and let Abby know we were on the ground. I was trying to figure out how Joey missed everything. Was the really slacking off like that? It didn't matter for now. I grabbed the paw rails and climbed into my little cabin. I stretched as much as I could and then dimmed the lights. I tuned the intercom to pick up the outside sounds. The wind howled unabated. From time to time I could hear the sound of the communication sensors deploying with clicks and clanks, and the shirr of the electric motors. After a while, the "civilized" noises stopped, and only the wind remained.

I’m not sure how long my nap was. At first, I thought I was still dreaming when I heard the voices of Joey and the other two Buns. The blizzard was gone, the wind was gone. I finally caught on that everybun was outside, and the sensors were picking up their voices from somewhere near the ship. 

After a quick stop at the litter cabin and few gulps of water, I hopped to the flight deck. An orange and yellow light was reflecting off the wall of the main deck. I grabbed one of the light suits and went to the loading dock. A few hops down the ramp and I was outside.

They guys have started a nice fire and even saved me a spot. I think Joey was telling them a story or feeding a line. It’s hard to tell sometimes which is which, because when he’s trying to make a point, Joey’s really likes to load up the brush with color, so to speak. I plopped into my chair and listened as I grabbed a paw full of the snow. It was cold and fluffy. I sniffed it but didn’t pick up any scents to worry about.

“Say, Major,” started the Young Bun, “... have you any stories about snow?”
“Methane snow? ... or something more exotic?” I egged him on. “No, I don’t have anything that exciting to tell you,” I went on.
“Hey, Joey, did you tell them about those two guys that landed inside the North Lands?” I teased.
“What two guys? No, I didn’t,” said Joey, puzzled.

So I went on, looking at he Younger Bun, “Toss me a chew bar, would you?” The Younger Bun obliged and Joey handed me a cup of warm mint and chamomile tea. I took a bite of the snack and watched the steam rise from my cup. In that moment, there was only the crackle of fire underscoring the absolute quiet of the winter’s night.

There were those two guys who went on a joyride in a ship like this one, only that was was the C model, I think. We never found out why they landed so deep into the North Lands. They had some kind of an emergency, maybe they overreacted, but they ended up crash landing. I think they were trying to build time - fair enough.

I paused and watched both Buns out of the corner of my eye. They fire did have me spellbound though. 

When the recovery crew found their ship, they only found one of the guys. He was inside, laid out on his back. Dead! The medics thought somebun had tried to administer medical aid to him, but that would have been hopeless. Later they found out how serious his injuries were. Anyway, there was no sign of the other guy. The team searched the ship, the landing site - all for naught. It’s as if he had vanished. When they inspected the outside of the ship, all seemed normal at first. Only the emergency antenna was partially deployed. It was the old-fashioned kind where you had to crank it out with a pipe. The idea was, it was to be used in the last resort. It was simple, sturdy, and reliable. Well, it was only halfway out of the well. The wrench handle was still in its socket.

That’s when they got worried. They started searching the area in widening circles away from the crash site. Eventually, a scanner registered a faint infrared signature some good distance away. At first, they thought it was a small critter of some kind, but it wasn’t moving.

I paused again and noticed the younger Bun was paying close attention now.

In the meantime, the investigators started piecing together what had happened inside the ship. The dead feller hit the console really hard and left some of his blood on it. The survivor, the commander, tried to help his pilot but their comms were down. So he tried to do the next thing and deploy that antenna. Later, they found signs of the ship taking a bad tumble on landing, and that's why some of the systems were down. Well, he was right to try that external antenna, but that was a two-bun job. He was supposed to have his buddy with him. The sad thing was, he didn't have to fully deploy that antenna. What was out was plenty to make contact with the Center. But, we think he vanished right there.

Now Joey was leaning forward a bit, his eyebrows were furrowed. The Younger Bun was twitching his nose nervously.

So, the rescue team went to check that little "hot spot" in the woods. When they got there, they discovered it was a shallow fire pit that was still worm. The heat signature came from a couple of stones around it. That was it. They started getting some heavy, and it was getting late, so the team had to abandon the search.

I finished my tea and asked Joey for a top off. It smelled great, and it tasted even better.

Oh, they had found one thing by that pit. It was a piece of rope. It wasn't even a proper rope or a tether, but a twisted twine. They put it in a bag and took it in for analysis. Much later, the examination of the fibers showed remain of the commander's tissue on it. Now, some say that the poor guy got snuffed out by the hairy beasts that supposed to inhabit the North Lands. It's all rubbish most likely, but the lore says that when they catch something they never had eaten before, they play a little game with their new delicacy.

The Younger Bun was getting visibly upset now, he was starting to pant. Even Joey thumped. But I kept my poker mouf and went on to finish.

So, according to the legends,  the beasts would tie their catch with a rope, and then one at a time would swallow it, pull it up and pass it around like that. Until the bones fell off the rope! Then I had another sip of my tea, "Oh, this is good, just what my belleh needed." 

Joey was looking at me frightened and confused. He tried to thump, but his foot wiggled instead, and the spastic twitch kicked up some snow. The Young Bun shut his eyes tight and pulled down on his ears, his mouth twisted with panic. The Younger Bun flopped on his side and played dead, feet straight out and all.

I set my cut to the side and tried to make a snowball again. But the snow was very dry and wouldn't lump easily. I had to work at it. "So, my friend," I started slowly as I pressed the snow and looked at the still sprawled out Younger Bun, "I think you know what I have to do, don't you?" I tossed the flimsy snowball at the Younger Bun and got him right in the ear. He jumped up immediately. 

The Young Bun figured out what had happened today and looked at his pilot with exasperation. 
"That's tough," Joey started, "you guys did so well, you had the check ride in a bag. And now ..., I don't know, Toes is gonna flunk you both. What a shame." Joey shook his head, but looked at me as if asking, "You're not gonna flunk them for the seat belts, are you?" But my expression stayed frozen. 

We called it a night shortly after that and went back inside the ship. I crawled inside my bunk, but this time, I kept the light on and turned off the intercom. Then I put on some ambient music because I scared myself silly with that story. Maybe I’ve gone a little too far? 

Next day, when the Young Bun briefed the return flight, he was adamant about carrying on as if it were a routine flight and not a busted checkride. Joey nodded approvingly. Earlier, Joey approached me to talk about his situation, and he wanted to give them a chance to make up for the seatbelt slip. I wasn’t so keen on that. It’s not that I didn’t like the Younger Bun. He was so sure of himself and was convinced that he was so good, that he thought he could do as he pleased and never get into trouble. That can very easily get him killed. If that’s not bad enough, he’ll take somebun else with him. And that - he had no right to do! Joey agreed, of course. After a while, I said, “Sure, throw something at them if you think they can make up the screwup. But leave me out of it.”

I knew Joey wouldn’t take it lightly, so I wasn’t too worried. I was curious actually. 

I didn’t have to wait long to see what he had in mind. During the ascent to orbit, Joey gave them a complete failure of the guidance system. Right at the moment of abort to orbit decision. They elected to proceed to orbit. The Younger Bun, still acting as a pilot, worked the problem. Again, he had to reach the same are of the console as he did the day before, but this time he stayed put. I don’t think he could have risen out of his seat with the G’s we were getting if he wanted to. He grumbled and grunted, twisted and stretched, but stayed where he had to be. Finally, had to loosen his seat belts monetarily. But when he was done, he tightened them up again and called out, sounding at the same time subdued, angry, and petulant, “Seat belts!”

“Seat belts!” yelled out the young Bun. Then Joey bellowed the same. I played along and growled, “Seat belts!” Instinctively, I tugged on mine, they were snug.

Once on orbit, the Young Bun ordered a hard system reboot to clean up that simulated guidance system failure. Of course, that would also clean out the system’s logs, and those simulated failures would disappear. That was the right way to go if one wanted to clean up such an event and Joye, and I couldn’t object to it. That emergency was Joey’s gift to them. I don’t know if they noticed it but cringed. “You all got away with this time,” I mumbled. The two buns looked at me wearily. Joey managed to find a window and had his mouf glued to it waiting to catch the sunrise.
