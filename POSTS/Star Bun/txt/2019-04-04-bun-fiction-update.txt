Bun Fiction Update - 2019-04-04


These are trying days at the Bunstronaut Headquarters. When we put bun Fiction on hold last June to concentrate on the CFI rating, deep down inside we knew that the best we could do in the next six months was to get a gauge on how fast the adventure would develop. Between all the excuses and life’ real constraints, progress came slowly. We wanted to know where we would be this February, and the best we could do is pass the written exam. The practical one is still months away.

There’s a ton of reading left. Then there’s the design of lesson plans, and so on. So far, the adventure is challenging all motives and assumptions we had at the start of this journey. 

One thing we learned so far is that all roads either lead or will lead to art. Bun fiction being a particularly compelling one. No matter the visualization or mental simulation we tried, it all ends with a question “And how am I going to paint, or write, or draw, when I’m doing X for a living?”

We really don’t see a way out of it. Whatever the nine-to-five routine will be, its only purpose is to fertilize something else. That something else always did and always will involve a pen, a brush, paper or canvas, not necessarily in that order.

Would we love to fly jets? Yes, ideally serving rabbit in some form or another. Hauling cargo and hoomins would never cut it. There was a time we had thought it would. Any flying serving some higher purpose will be tolerated, enjoyed and loved, but serve it will.

So if anything, the future looks cloudier and muckier, and darker than ever. The compass we thought we had gone haywire.
