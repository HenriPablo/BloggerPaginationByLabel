BunFiction Update - The Pancake Report - 2019-05-31

Pancake got up shortly after the morning sun broke into the house and five in the morning. Once the rays warmed her back and wouldn't stop tickling her eyelids, no amount of will power could help her pretend she was still sleeping. She sat up on her pad and listened. The house was still quiet, except for somebun making noise with the dishes. The hoomins were still asleep; they never got ups this early on the weekends.

After a short stop at the bin, she hopped toward the commotion. Joey and Molly had the breakfast noms under control. Fresh cawwot juice, fruit, and alfalfa waited to be devoured. No bun could ask for more. The sun, though, the sun stopped being giddy and invigorating and became annoying. At the most, it moved no more but a fraction of degree in the sky but somehow managed to hit the wrong nerve with Pancake.

She attached an innocent, ripe raspberry and bit it in half. The juice splattered everywhere and run down her mouf as Joey and Molly winced with disapproval. What is she on about now?" thought Joey.

"So, what's the latest with that scribe of ours?" grunted Pancake.
"Well, good morning to you too, Pancake, and you're most welcome, you know how I love to cook for everybun," started Joey. Molly sat up and turned her head to face the sun, eyes closed, trying to catch every ray of light she could.
"There's very little news from the 'scribe,'" Joey continued. "He passed the written test in January and has been reading since then. The last I heard, he was starting on reading the regulations and was about to start on preparing the lesson plans. His instructor told him to get three of them ready for their next meeting," said Joey and took another bite of alfalfa.

"Do you have that on paper of some kind, Joey, or did you get all that through that mystery connection you have with him? I'm not sure I'm willing to trust that mind-melting of yours or those 'talks' you have with him. I like paper, a ticker tape, or something. I want to get my teeth into, do you get what I mean, Joey?" snarled Pancake derisively.

"That's all I've got, so take it or leave it," snapped Joey.
"Look here, Joye. When we finished the last story a year ago, we were supposed to go on a vacation. The next episode was supposed to decide what kind of world we would live in. But here we are, about to go through another summer getting baked in that limbo among the worlds that may or may not come to pass. At this rate, it sounds to me - don't have a clue when he's going to get done with that 'instructor adventure' of his. Maybe by Christmas, maybe by next spring or even Sumer. We don't know, do we?" asked Pancake. She came down quite a bit by now and almost sounded friendly.

Joey cleared his throat, and went on, "You're right. I'm picking up a lot of trepidations there. Fear of this or that, apprehension." Joey paused for a moment "... one way or another, he'll be dealing with a whole new world when this thing is done. He thinks he's not supposed to be in that position, having to face those kinds of changes. Maybe, on one paw, this is not supposed to be happening, but it is. He's starting to straddle two, different realities. Eh, maybe his head will explode, and we'll have nothing to fret about."

For a while, no bun said a word. Joey took out a half-burnt catnip stogie and lit it up. "Ha!" chuckled Molly and turned toward Pancake when she heard the crackle of the stogie starting to glow. "Weren't you supposed to quit that?" asked Molly, a bit too loud. Joey nodded, "Yeah, there's supposed to be a whole episode just about that. Also, about me visiting my elementary school."
"See what I mean? He's gonna be dead because the story will never come out and - Joey here - will never quit those bloody, stinking stogies!" exclaimed Pancake as she pointed her nose toward Joey angrily. She turned toward the doorway and threw over her shoulder, "I'll wake up the rest of the crew before the hoomins get up.
We'll just have to hold on for a bit longer." and she foot flicked Joey and Molly. Or maybe her feet slipped when she tried to push off too hard.
