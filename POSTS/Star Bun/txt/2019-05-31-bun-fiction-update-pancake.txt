BunFiction Update - The Pancake Report - 2019-05-31

Pancake got up shortly after the morning sun broke into the house around five in the morning. Once the rays warmed her back and wouldn't stop tickling her eyelids, no amount of will power could help her pretend she was still sleeping. She sat up on her pad and listened. The house was still quiet, except for somebun making noise with the dishes. The hoomins were still snoozing; they never got ups this early on the weekends.

After a short stop at the bin, she hopped toward the commotion. She sped up and launched into the air, shaking her head and wiggling her torso. For a split moment, she became both a bunn and a wave. Pancake landed sideways and almost crashed into Joey and Molly.  They had the breakfast noms under control. Fresh cawwot juice, fruit, and alfalfa waited to be devoured. No bun could ask for more.

She grabbed a ripe raspberry and bit it in half with relish. The juice splattered everywhere and run down her mouf as Joey and Molly watched surprised. What is she on about now?" thought Joey.

"So, what's the latest with that scribe of ours?" whispered Pancake with a grin and a shiver run down her body as if she was about to binky again. 
"Well, good morning to you too, Pancake. Ya really like my cooking, eh?" said Joey. Molly sat up and turned her head to face the sun, eyes closed, and tried to catch every ray of light she could.
"There's very little news from the 'scribe,'" Joey cautioned. "He passed the written test in January and has been reading since then. The last I heard, he was starting to read the regulations and was about to start preparing the lesson plans. His instructor told him to get three of them ready for their next meeting," said Joey and took another bite of alfalfa.

"Do you have that on paper of some kind, Joey, or did it all come to you through that mystery connection you have with him? I'm not sure I'm willing to trust that mind-melting of yours or those 'talks' you have with him. I like paper, give me a ticker tape, or something. I want to get my teeth into it, do you get what I mean, Joey?" asked Pancake.

"That's all I've got, so take it or leave it," said Joey and his eyes dropped a little.
"Look here, Joey. When we finished the last story a year ago, we were supposed to go on a vacation. The next episode was supposed to have a clue about what kind of world we would live in. But here we are, about to go through another Summer, get baked, languish in that limbo among the worlds that may or may not come to pass. At this rate - it looks to me - we don't have a clue when he's going to get done with that 'instructor adventure' of his, do we? Maybe by Christmas, maybe by next Spring or even Summer. We don't know, eh?" mused Pancake. She closed her eyes and turned toward the sun.

Joey looked toward where the Pleiades ought to be, cleared his throat, and went on, "I'm picking up a lot of trepidation there. Fear of this or that, apprehension." Joey paused for a moment "... one way or another, he'll be dealing with a whole new world when this thing is done. He thinks he's not supposed to be in that position, having to face those kinds of changes. On one paw, this is not supposed to be happening at all, but it is. He's starting to straddle two, different realities. Oh well, maybe his head will explode, and we'll have nothing to fret about," Joey sighed despondently and turned toward the sun.

For a while, no bun said a word. Joey took out a half-burnt catnip stogie and lit it up. "Ha!" chuckled Molly and turned toward Pancake when she heard the crackle of the stogie starting to glow. "Weren't you supposed to quit that?" asked Molly, a bit too loud. Joey nodded, "Yeah, there's supposed to be a whole story just about that. Also, about me visiting my elementary school."
"See what I mean? Because the story will never come out - Joey here - will never quit those bloody, stinking stogies and will die from lung cancer!" exclaimed Pancake as she pointed her nose toward Joey angrily. She turned toward the doorway and threw over her shoulder, "We'll just have to hold on for a bit longer. I'll wake up the rest of the crew before the hoomins get up." 

Maybe her feet slipped when she pushed off too hard, or maybe she meant to foot flick Joey and Molly.
