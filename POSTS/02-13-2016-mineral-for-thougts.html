            <strong>Last Week on the Disapprovers: </strong>
            After an encounter with a lynx, Zues and Milla meet with Molly and Mr. Toes. They prepare to explore a mysterious, tube like object found at the deep end of the artery.

            Zeus crossed the boundary  between the artery and the pipe thing first. <span class="disapprover-pix-tip molly" data-disapprover="molly">Molly</span> followed and I was last. We paused and took a good look around. Zeus was carefully sniffing around. I did too and it definitely smelled like other critters have gone through here. This tube was maybe 1/4 packed with dirt. It had to take a lot of time and  a lot of little footsteps to carry in this much dirt and muck. The 'ceiling' in this tube was maybe 2 bunns telescoping tall. Molly took out her SwissBunny knife and probed the dirt under our feet. It was packed hard. It was softer than sandstone, but not much. Zeus went to the side and tried to scrape the side of the tube. He banged hard on the round wall of the tube, hoping to get a better feel of what it's made of. I expected the sounds of echoing like you'd get in a cave, but his pounding sounded like dull thuds. He chipped off a small piece. We passed it around, feeling its sharp edges and rough surface. I think that stone like coating had to build up over a very long time. I could see very thin layers of different colors. We wondered how thick that stone lining was.
