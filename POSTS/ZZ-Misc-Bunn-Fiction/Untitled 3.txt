The Bunday Evening Thumps

Finally, Agent Hoomin succumbed to the dreams and nightmares of conversations with Mr. Spressos. He didn’t have to and visit Mr. Spressos in the park, in the middle of the night anymore. Like bouts of fever, fragments of encounters with Mr. Spressos plagued his imagination.

There were bits about Spressos catching hippies and their souls or something. 
“Oh, Mr. Hoomin, but we don’t need the entire hippie. We only need the soul. You see, we’ve been trying to extract the antibodies for greed and corruption, fear and hatred, resignation and despair.”

At first, the hoomin thought this was so we can have a vaccine for those maladies. In the next moment, he knew it was none of that. They wanted to know how those antibodies work to better defeat hem. As he sat facing Mr. Spressos in the bowels of a black helicopter, he thought something in one of the cargo nets moved. The chopper began to shake and scream violently as if the motor was coming undone. The hoomin felt paralyzed.

Suddenly, Agent Hoomin jumped and sat up, drenched with cold sweat. Somewhere near, a garbage trucked swallowed a load of trash and lurched on. The hoomin overslept again.
