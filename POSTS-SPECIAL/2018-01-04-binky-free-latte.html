            Yesterday morning we have lost Latte. We took her to the vet because the pus in her leg returned. They cleaned it up again under anesthesia, and all seemed well as Latte was coming out of sedation. That's when she went into cardiac arrest. The staff attempted CPR, but it was unsuccessful.
