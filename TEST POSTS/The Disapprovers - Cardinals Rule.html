            We started chinning everything in sight. This is our garden
            now and we’re marking it so. I started sniffing and
            inspecting greens coming out of the ground right around my
            paws. There was grass, little flowers, even some dandelions;
            fresh, crisp and juicy. I snipped one off and savored it. As
            I sliced through it, I tried to take in its fresh aroma. I
            had no idea how intense a simple green could taste.

            We started working our way through the rows. Out of the
            corner of my eye I saw Molly and Suzy working over some
            parsley. Abby meandered across the rows checking everything
            out. Once in awhile you could see her pop up as she inspected
            greens from root to top.

            I started to wonder as I hopped from green to green. Who
            taught me all this, how did I know what to look for, what to
            avoid, what to do? When I got to the first bunch of kale, I
            took a nip of it and tore out a big chunk from its leaf.
            Sitting up and noming I tried to recall when I last saw my
            mom. I tried to remember if we ever went out into the garden?
            I couldn’t tell if what I remembered really happened or not.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            I sat and nomed slowly, my attention dissolving in the
            tastes, smells and this surreal reminiscing. I was taking my
            time to enjoy this new life.

            Mr. Toes didn’t notice Abby telescoping, yelling and waving
            her paws at him. In the adventure control room Zeus sounded
            alarm for everybunny to take cover immediately. Zeus and
            Apollo watched as an unknown object slowly entered the
            tracker screen, drawing a circular path. It took them a
            moment to identify it as a large bird of prey. At first they
            thought it was an eagle. As data poured in, Apollo realized
            it’s not an eagle, but a female hawk. Because they’re bigger
            than male hawks, sometimes they get mistaken for eagles.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            Suzy and Molly immediately scooted off toward the fraser fir
            in the back of the garden. As Abby spun around to do the same
            she noticed that Mr. Toes appeared to have been lost in own
            world, oblivious to everything around him. She stood up and
            yelled, “Major, cover! We have to run!” He didn’t seem to
            notice her.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            “Somebunny get his fuzzy bum before the beast does!” came on
            Zeus.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            Abby rushed toward Mr. Toes and almost knocked him over. She
            grabbed his vest and started pulling him toward the tree,
            hoping he’ll snap out of his stupor. He followed her, looking
            frightened, slowly returning to the shared reality. At least
            they were moving and Mr. Toes started to pick up his pace.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            The hawk was taking her time to survey the pickings from high
            up, more interested in finding decent updrafts than snacks.
            But the day was getting on and it was time to think of
            something to eat. Easy pickings were always welcomed.
            Finally, she spotted something, looking like bunnies, but not
            quite.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            In her black vest, Abby didn’t look like a typical bunn. Her
            head did, but not the rest of her body. Without the vest, all
            white, she would stick out like a sore thumb against the
            ground. So it took a while for the hunter to catch on and
            decide she may as well try going for one of them. Maybe the
            one standing still? The others were running for cover. She
            started preparing for the dive, trying to predict which way
            if any, would her prize try to flee.

            Zeus was giving updates second by second; Frankie and Freddie
            came out of their burrows; it was their day off. So did Izzie
            and Millie. They stood around, staring at the tracker,
            watching the bird circling, Mr. Toes standing still and Abby
            running toward him.

        <div class="story-txt">
            They could only hope the bunns would get to safety of the
            trees before the bird could get to them.

        <div class="story-txt">
            The hawk had to make a lot of adjustments and calculations
            before she could drop on them. How high was she, which way
            was the air moving, was it gusty or steady? Now, everything
            depended on a split second timing. Situation was a bit more
            complicated though. Those bunns, if they were bunns, run for
            cover much, much sooner than they should have. She’s never
            seen that before. They weren’t supposed to have an idea that
            they were in danger. As she pondered this anomaly, she pulled
            her wing in and started gaining a lot of speed.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            That little black and white feller sitting still, … that’s
            just too bad. Something was running toward that little bun
            and the hawk thought she might get both of them! She was
            really picking up speed now.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            Zeus could only watch.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            The hawk was fully committed to the dive, she was making the
            slightest of corrections now. She didn’t see the red ball of
            feathers about to blindside her. A small cardinal crashed
            into her head, feet first, blocking out her vision for a
            split second. But the hawk had too much energy now and that
            little collision could not stop her. Then she got hit from
            the other side and her trajectory was seriously altered. A
            third and a fourth hit! The hawk realized what was happened.
            She was getting mobbed by cardinals. She was still in a dive,
            but she knew she was just plunging toward the earth; the hunt
            was over. Ironically, she was under attack. The cardinals
            could it hurt her too much, but they sure could make her life
            miserable. And they knew it. Their pounding on the big, older
            hawk was relentless. In his younger days she could have
            snatched one of them in mid air just to make an example of it
            for the others, but she was too big and too slow. They were
            quicker and more agile, they could strike fast and get away
            instantly. The strong, powerful and frightening bird was
            getting outmaneuvered.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            The best she could do was to arrest the loss of altitude and
            try to get away from the impertinent little fliers. She would
            have to look for food somewhere else.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            The bunns were really working hard, speeding toward the old
            christmas tree. The day was warming up quite a bit now. Abby
            and Mr. Toes were really hot, their vest acting like heat
            collectors.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            Every ratty friend in the control center was dumbfounded. Why
            would Cardinals attack the hawk in this time of year? The
            cardinals were not nesting anymore, the hawk didn’t really
            present any danger to them. Were they on a practice flight
            and this was an opportunity to pick on someone bigger? It
            didn’t matter now. They broke up the dive just in time and
            the hawk had barely time and energy to level off and climb
            away from them.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            I had no idea what happened. I sensed that I had to follow
            Abby, that the situation was grave. Something inside of me
            took over and turned my mind blank. It drove my legs. My paws
            worked the hardest they ever did. I was really hot and
            getting hotter. We dove under the fir, plowing into the old
            needles and all sorts of decomposing matter.
        </div>
        <div class="story-txt">
            When we picked ourselves up, we turned around and huddled
            with Suzy and Molly; and we watched the brawl in the sky. The
            hawk was trying to save her own hide instead of tearing up
            mine.
